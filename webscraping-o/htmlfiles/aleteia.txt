Sins are not only the breaking of God’s commandments, but are also a cause of discord in both God’s benevolent ordering of the universe as well as in his providential guidance of our lives.

For instance, we can do good works or patiently suffer the trials of life. If we are not able to properly atone for our sins in this way during the course of our time on earth, our souls would ultimately need to be healed and purified through the sufferings of purgatory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet there are some saints who, through their lives of heroic patience and charity, have already done more than enough to ready their own souls for heaven.

Given the Church’s doctrine on the communion of saints (the Church’s teaching that all Christians share a deep spiritual bond with each other), it is possible for one Christian’s overabundant merit to be applied to the spiritual healing of another soul still in need of purification.

Though forgiven, there is still a need to rectify this disorder.\r\n\r\nThe \u003ci\u003eCatechism of the Catholic Church\u003c/i\u003e defines an indulgence as “a remission before God of the temporal punishment due to sins whose guilt has already been forgiven” (CCC 1471).\r\n\r\nTo understand what the term “temporal punishment” means in this context, we need to keep in mind that there is a distinction between receiving God’s forgiveness of our sins and the necessity of contending with our sins’ consequences. Sins are not only the breaking of God’s commandments, but are also a cause of discord in both God’s benevolent ordering of the universe as well as in his providential guidance of our lives. While our sins are truly and fully forgiven in the sacrament of penance, our souls can still suffer the spiritual damage caused by our offenses.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways we can repair this damage, or “remit the temporal punishment” that our sins deserve. For instance, we can do good works or patiently suffer the trials of life. If we are not able to properly atone for our sins in this way during the course of our time on earth, our souls would ultimately need to be healed and purified through the sufferings of purgatory.\r\n\r\nYet there are some saints who, through their lives of heroic patience and charity, have already done more than enough to ready their own souls for heaven. Because of this, the Church effectively has a surplus of goodness, which is referred to as the “treasury of the Church” (cf. CCC 1467). Given the Church’s doctrine on the communion of saints (the Church’s teaching that all Christians share a deep spiritual bond with each other), it is possible for one Christian’s overabundant merit to be applied to the spiritual healing of another soul still in need of purification. As the \u003ci\u003eCatechism\u003c/i\u003e states: “In this wonderful exchange, the holiness of one profits others, well beyond the harm that the sin of one could cause others” (CCC 1465).\r\n\r\nWe can recall that Christ told St. Peter, “whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven” (Matt. 18:18). Therefore, Catholics believe that the Holy Father, as the successor to St. Peter, has the power to distribute this excess grace to faithful Christians. An indulgence is the act through which this sharing of grace happens.\r\n\r\nIn other words, since the plenary indulgence completely remits that due penalty, those who die without having fallen back into sin do not need the purification of Purgatory and may enter directly into heaven (cf. \u003ca href=\"http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2N.HTM\"\u003eCatechism of the Catholic Church\u003c/a\u003e, 1030-1032).\u003cspan class=\"Apple-converted-space\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\r\n\r\nAccording to Tradition, the benefits of the blessing \"Urbi et Orbi\" are effective for all those who receive the blessing with faith and devotion, even if they receive it by listening or watching live through mass media.

It is traditional in this month to pray the Rosary at home within the family. The restrictions of the pandemic have made us come to appreciate all the more this “family” aspect, also from a spiritual point of view.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, I want to encourage everyone to rediscover the beauty of praying the Rosary at home in the month of May. This can be done either as a group or individually; you can decide according to your own situations, making the most of both opportunities. The key to doing this is always simplicity, and \u003ca href=\"http://www.vatican.va/special/rosary/index_rosary.htm\"\u003eit is easy also on the internet\u003c/a\u003e to find good models of prayers to follow.\r\n\r\nI am also providing two prayers to Our Lady that you can recite at the end of the Rosary, and that I myself will pray in the month of May, in spiritual union with all of you. I include them with this letter so that they are available to everyone.\r\n\r\n[read_also art1=\"484855\" /]\r\n\r\nDear brothers and sisters, contemplating the face of Christ with the heart of Mary our Mother will make us even more united as a spiritual family and will help us overcome this time of trial.

As a result, it's not surprising that early versions of the stations would keep the number at seven.

John 19:27).\r\n\r\nKeeping in mind this historical scenario, many traditions hold that Joseph died in the arms or presence of Jesus and Mary.
