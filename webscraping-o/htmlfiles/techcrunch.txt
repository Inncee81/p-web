It requires patience and focus, but the freedom to create a meaningful product, on your terms, is worth more than even the biggest VC check.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tThe freedom to create a meaningful product, on your terms, is worth more than even the biggest VC check.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">I started my company,<\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.jotform.com\/\"> JotForm<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">, in 2006. We\u2019ve grown steadily from a simple web tool into a product that serves more than 8 million users \u2014 without taking a dime in outside funding. We\u2019re profitable in an industry with big-name competitors like Google.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Most importantly, I still love this company and its mission, and I want the same for my fellow entrepreneurs. If you\u2019re a SaaS founder who\u2019s wary of VC funding, here are my best bootstrapping tips.<\/p>\n<h2>Keep your day job<\/h2>\n<p>Success stories from founders who leap blindly into business without resources or relevant experience are compelling, but they\u2019re the exception, not the rule. Working inside another organization can build your skills, your network and even inspire great product ideas.<\/p>\n<p>After finishing college with a computer science degree, I worked as a developer for a New York media company. The editors always needed custom web forms, which were tedious and time consuming to build. I kept thinking, \u201cThere has to be a better way.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That daily frustration led me to start JotForm \u2014 but I didn\u2019t leave my job right away. I stayed with the media firm for five years and worked on my product on the side. By the time I was ready to go all in, I had the confidence, experience and savings I needed.<\/p>\n<p>Many of the world\u2019s biggest companies began as side projects, including Twitter, Craigslist, Slack, Instagram, Trello, and a little venture called Apple. If your day job doesn\u2019t pay enough to fund the early stages of your business, consider a side gig or consulting work. There are so many ways to set yourself up for success without the pressure of VC cash or selling a chunk of your business.<\/p>\n<h2>Know you\u2019re not alone<\/h2>\n<p>The exact numbers shift every year, but data compiled by<a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/230011\"> Fundable<\/a> show that only 0.05% of U.S. startups are backed by VCs. Another 0.91% are funded by angel investors. The vast majority, at 57%, are funded by credit and personal loans, while 38% get funding from friends and family.<\/p>\n<p>It may feel like most founders raise multimillion-dollar rounds, but that\u2019s simply not the case. It\u2019s also good to remember that securing VC money is complicated and time consuming. You can spend months taking meetings and presenting the perfect deck \u2014 and still leave empty handed. Be patient and stick to your own path.<\/p>\n<h2>Measure profits, not popularity<\/h2>\n<p>SaaS founders often emphasize vanity metrics, like user acquisitions and total downloads. These numbers can measure short-term popularity, but they don\u2019t reveal how users and customers feel about your product \u2014 or your long-term potential.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bootstrapping a SaaS company is not only possible \u2014 I believe it\u2019s a saner, more sustainable way to build and scale a business.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574430,"featured_media":2119912,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"06e2ff06-c045-33cb-8515-a7dd8ab5c0a3"},"categories":[25515,576605952,20429,35394854],"tags":[70302,576846312,576846278,183,29172,449557042],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796353],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/GettyImages-1237975669.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/383KAEP","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.46,"featured":true,"subtitle":"Bootstrapping is a more sustainable way to build and scale","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[2119900],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2119809"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2119809"}],"version-history":[{"count":8,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2119809\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2120114,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2119809\/revisions\/2120114"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/aytekin-tank"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2119809&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574430"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2119912"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2119809"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2119809"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2119809"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2119809"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2119809"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2119809"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2119809"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":2119900,"name":"Aytekin Tank","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/aytekin-tank\/","description":"Aytekin Tank is the founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jotform.com\/\">JotForm<\/a>, an online form builder.

Don\u2019t miss our discussion with Congresswoman Lee, California\u2019s East Bay representative, about the opportunities to create an equal playing field in tech so that underrepresented investors, founders, designers and coders can reap the benefits.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fireside Chat &#8211; Diversity Is More Than Hiring People of Color:<\/strong> It may appear that the country is accepting change \u2014 from racial diversity to equality in the workplace. However, we still have ways to go. For example, organizational diversity is still about hiring from diverse talent pools. However, activating the full potential of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) requires more than a \u201cpeople strategy.\u201d Robust and sustainable work in this area requires embedding DEI principles, policies, systems and practices into all parts of the business, including the employee and customer experience, brand culture and overall industry\/corporate citizenship. Sponsored by Onshape.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pitch Feedback:<\/strong> Join us for a pitch feedback session for select TC Include founders exhibiting at TC Sessions: Justice 2021 and moderated by TechCrunch staff.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Access All Areas &#8211; Designing Accessibility From Day One:<\/strong> This session examines the importance of ensuring accessible product design from the beginning. We\u2019ll ask how the social and medical models of disability influence technological evolution. Integrating the expertise of disabled technologists, makers, investors, scientists and software engineers into your company\u2019s DNA from the very beginning is vital to the pursuit of a functioning and equitable society.

It plans to ramp up research and development in the San Francisco Bay Area and expand its market reach<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> through new partnerships.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The spinout is consistent with Uber&#8217;s aim to narrow the focus of its business on ride-hailing and delivery in a push toward profitability. This strategy began to take shape after Uber&#8217;s public market debut in May 2019 and accelerated last year as the COVID-19 pandemic put pressure on the ride-hailing company. Two years ago, Uber had enterprises across the transportation landscape, from ride-hailing and micromobility to logistics, public transit, food delivery and futuristic bets like autonomous vehicles and air taxis. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has dismantled the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach as he pushes the company toward profitability.<\/p>\n<p>In 2020, Uber offloaded shared scooter and bike unit Jump in a complex deal with Lime, sold a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/02\/uber-sells-500m-stake-in-its-freight-business-as-the-ride-hailing-giant-works-to-conserve-cash\/\">stake worth $500 million<\/a> in its logistics spinoff Uber Freight and rid itself of its autonomous vehicle unit Uber ATG and its air taxi play Uber Elevate.

Aurora didn\u2019t pay cash for Uber ATG. Instead, Uber handed over its equity in ATG and invested $400 million into Aurora, which gave it a 26% stake in the combined company. In a similarly crafted deal, Uber Elevate was sold to Joby Aviation in December.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"nuBUPHpzeN\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/07\/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b\/\">Uber sells self-driving unit Uber ATG in deal that will push Aurora&#8217;s valuation to $10B<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Uber sells self-driving unit Uber ATG in deal that will push Aurora&#8217;s valuation to $10B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/07\/uber-sells-self-driving-unit-uber-atg-in-deal-that-will-push-auroras-valuation-to-10b\/embed\/#?secret=nuBUPHpzeN\" data-secret=\"nuBUPHpzeN\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Postmates X, the robotics division of the on-demand delivery startup that\u00a0Uber acquired last year for $2.65 billion, has officially spun out as an independent company called Serve Robotics.

exploiting four previously undisclosed security flaws in Exchange Server, an enterprise email product built by the software giant.<\/p>\n<p>The technology company said Tuesday that it believes the hacking group, which it calls Hafnium, tries to steal information from a broad range of U.S.-based organizations, including law firms and defense contractors, but also infectious disease researchers and policy think tanks.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft said Hafnium used the four newly discovered security vulnerabilities to break into Exchange email servers running on company networks, granting the attackers to steal data from a victim&#8217;s organization \u2014 such as email accounts and address books \u2014 and the ability to plant malware.

I think we\u2019re already a bit frustrated by just saying take it down or leave it up,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;What happens if you want to&#8230; make something less viral? What happens if you want to put an interstitial?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;So I think all these things are things that the Board may ask Facebook for in time. But we have to get our feet under the table first \u2014 we can do what we want.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAt some point we\u2019re going to ask to see the algorithm, I feel sure \u2014 whatever that means,&#8221; Rusbridger also told the committee. &#8220;Whether we can understand it when we see it is a different matter.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>To many people, Facebook&#8217;s Trump ban is uncontroversial &#8212; given the risk of further violence posed by letting Trump continue to use its megaphone to foment insurrection. There are also clear and repeat breaches of Facebook&#8217;s community standards if you want to be a stickler for its rules.<\/p>\n<p>Among supporters of the ban is Facebook&#8217;s former chief security officer, Alex Stamos, who has since been working on wider trust and safety issues for online platforms via the Stanford Internet Observatory.<\/p>\n<p>Stamos was urging both Twitter and Facebook to cut Trump off before everything kicked off, writing in early January: &#8220;There are no legitimate equities left and labeling won&#8217;t do it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The last reason to keep Trump&#39;s account up was the possibility that he would try to put the genie back in the bottle but as many expected, that is impossible for him.<\/p>\n<p>There will always be the alt-sites and peer-to-peer, but at least the damage he does would be more contained.<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Alex Stamos (@alexstamos) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alexstamos\/status\/1346932574317264898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 6, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>But in the wake of big tech moving <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/09\/the-deplatforming-of-a-president\/\">almost as a unit<\/a> to finally put Trump on mute, a number of world leaders and lawmakers were quick to express misgivings at the big tech power flex.<\/p>\n<p>Germany&#8217;s chancellor called Twitter&#8217;s ban on him &#8220;problematic&#8221;, saying it raised troubling questions about the power of the platforms to interfere with speech. While other lawmakers in Europe seized on the unilateral action &#8212; saying it underlined the need for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/11\/europe-seizes-on-social-medias-purging-of-trump-to-bang-the-drum-for-regulation\/\">proper democratic regulation of tech giants<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The sight of the world&#8217;s most powerful social media platforms being able to mute a democratically elected president (even one as divisive and unpopular as Trump) made politicians of all stripes feel queasy.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s entirely predictable response was, of course, to outsource this two-sided conundrum to the FOB. After all, that was its whole plan for the Board. The Board would be there to deal with the most headachey and controversial content moderation stuff.<\/p>\n<p>And on that level Facebook&#8217;s Oversight Board is doing exactly the job Facebook intended for it.<\/p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s interesting that this unofficial &#8216;supreme court&#8217; is already feeling frustrated by the limited binary choices it&#8217;s asked them for. (Of, in the Trump case, either reversing the ban entirely or continuing it indefinitely.)<\/p>\n<p>The FOB&#8217;s unofficial message seems to be that the tools are simply far too blunt. Although Facebook has never said it will be bound by any wider policy suggestions the Board might make &#8212; only that it will abide by the specific individual review decisions. (Which is why a common critique of the Board is that it&#8217;s toothless where it matters.)<\/p>\n<p>How aggressive the Board will be in pushing Facebook to be less frustrating very much remains to be seen.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNone of this is going to be solved quickly,\u201d Rusbridger went on to tell the committee in more general remarks on the challenges of moderating speech in the digital era. Getting to grips with the Internet&#8217;s publishing revolution could in fact, he implied, take the work of generations &#8212; making the customary reference the long tail of societal disruption that flowed from Gutenberg inventing the printing press.<\/p>\n<p>If Facebook was hoping the FOB would kick hard (and thorny-in-its-side) questions around content moderation into long and intellectual grasses it&#8217;s surely delighted with the level of beard stroking which Rusbridger&#8217;s evidence implies is now going on inside the Board. (If, possibly, slightly less enchanted by the prospect of its appointees asking it if they can poke around its algorithmic black boxes.)<\/p>\n<p>Kate Klonick, an assistant professor at St John&#8217;s University Law School, was also giving evidence to the committee &#8212; having written an article on the inner workings of the FOB, published recently in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/tech\/annals-of-technology\/inside-the-making-of-facebooks-supreme-court\">New Yorker<\/a>, after she was given wide-ranging access by Facebook to observe the process of the body being set up.<\/p>\n<p>The Lords committee was keen to learn more on the workings of the FOB and pressed the witnesses several times on the question of the Board&#8217;s independence from Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>Rusbridger batted away concerns on that front \u2014 saying \u201cwe don\u2019t feel we work for Facebook at all\u201d. Though Board members are paid by Facebook via a trust it set up to put the FOB at arm&#8217;s length from the corporate mothership. And the committee didn&#8217;t shy away or raising the payment point to query how genuinely independent they can be?<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I feel highly independent,\u201d Rusbridger said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any obligation at all to be nice to Facebook or to be horrible to Facebook.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the nice things about this Board is occasionally people will say but if we did that that will scupper Facebook\u2019s economic model in such and such a country. To which we answer well that\u2019s not our problem. Which is a very liberating thing,&#8221; he added.<\/p>\n<p>Of course it\u2019s hard to imagine a sitting member of the FOB being able to answer the independence question any other way \u2014 unless they were simultaneously resigning their commission (which, to be clear, Rusbridger wasn\u2019t).<\/p>\n<p>He confirmed that Board members can serve three terms of three years apiece &#8212; so he could have almost a decade of beard-stroking on Facebook&#8217;s behalf ahead of him.<\/p>\n<p>Klonick, meanwhile, emphasized the scale of the challenge it had been for Facebook to try to build from scratch a quasi-independent oversight body and create distance between itself and its claimed watchdog.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBuilding an institution to be a watchdog institution \u2014 it is incredibly hard to transition to institution-building and to break those bonds [between the Board and Facebook] and set up these new people with frankly this huge set of problems and a new technology and a new back end and a content management system and everything,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Rusbridger had said the Board went through an extensive training process which involved participation from Facebook representatives during the &#8216;onboarding&#8217;. But went on to describe a moment when the training had finished and the FOB realized some Facebook reps were still joining their calls &#8212; saying that at that point the Board felt empowered to tell Facebook to leave.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis was exactly the type of moment \u2014 having watched this \u2014 that I knew had to happen,\u201d added Klonick. \u201cThere had to be some type of formal break \u2014 and it was told to me that this was a natural moment that they had done their training and this was going to be moment of push back and breaking away from the nest. And this was it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>However if your measure of independence is not having Facebook <em>literally listening in on<\/em> <em>the Board&#8217;s calls<\/em> you do have to query how much Kool Aid Facebook may have successfully doled out to its chosen and willing participants over the long and intricate process of programming its own watchdog &#8212; including to extra outsiders it allowed in to observe the set up.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Dipeq76Iv8\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/28\/under-consideration\/\">Toothless: Facebook proposes a weak Oversight Board<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Toothless: Facebook proposes a weak Oversight Board&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/28\/under-consideration\/embed\/#?secret=Dipeq76Iv8\" data-secret=\"Dipeq76Iv8\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The committee was also interested in the fact the FOB has so far mostly ordered Facebook to reinstate content its moderators had previously taken down.<\/p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/facebooks-oversight-body-overturns-four-154522911.html\">January<\/a>, when the Board issued its first decisions, it overturned four out of five Facebook takedowns &#8212; including in relation to a number of hate speech cases. The move quickly attracted criticism over the direction of travel. After all, the wider critique of Facebook&#8217;s business is it&#8217;s far too reluctant to remove toxic content (it only <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/12\/facebook-in-a-reversal-will-now-ban-holocaust-denial-content-under-its-hate-speech-policy\/\">banned holocaust denial last year<\/a>, for example).

Which is let people know the exact rule, given them a fact to fact type of analysis or application of the rule to the facts and give them that kind of read in to what they&#8217;re seeing and people will be happier with what&#8217;s going on.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Or at least just feel a little bit more like there is a process and it&#8217;s not just this black box that&#8217;s censoring them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In his response to the committee&#8217;s query, Rusbridger discussed how he approaches review decision-making.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn most judgements I begin by thinking well why would we restrict freedom of speech in this particular case \u2014 and that does get you into interesting questions,\u201d he said, having earlier summed up his school of thought on speech as akin to the \u2018fight bad speech with more speech\u2019 Justice Brandeis type view.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe right not to be offended has been engaged by one of the cases \u2014 as opposed to the borderline between being offended and being harmed,&#8221; he went on. \u201cThat issue has been argued about by political philosophers for a long time and it certainly will never be settled absolutely.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;But if you went along with establishing a right not to be offended that would have huge implications for the ability to discuss almost anything in the end. And yet there have been one or two cases where essentially Facebook, in taking something down, has invoked something like that.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHarm as oppose to offence is clearly something you would treat differently,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd we\u2019re in the fortunate position of being able to hire in experts and seek advisors on the harm here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While Rusbridger didn&#8217;t sound troubled about the challenges and pitfalls facing the Board when it may have to set the &#8220;borderline&#8221; between offensive speech and harmful speech itself &#8212; being able to (further) outsource expertise presumably helps &#8212; he did raise a number of other operational concerns during the session. Including over the lack of technical expertise among current board members (who were purely Facebook&#8217;s picks).<\/p>\n<p>Without technical expertise how can the Board \u2018examine the algorithm\u2019, as he suggested it would want to, because it won&#8217;t be able to understand Facebook\u2019s content distribution machine in any meaningful way?<\/p>\n<p>Since the Board currently lacks technical expertise, it does raise wider questions about its function &#8212; and whether its first learned cohort might not be played as useful idiots from Facebook&#8217;s self-interested perspective &#8212; by helping it gloss over and deflect deeper scrutiny of its algorithmic, money-minting choices.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t really understand how the Facebook machine functions, technically and economically, how can you conduct any kind of meaningful oversight at all? (Rusbridger evidently gets that &#8212; but is also content to wait and see how the process plays out. No doubt the intellectual exercise and insider view is fascinating. &#8220;So far I&#8217;m finding it highly absorbing,&#8221; as he admitted in his evidence opener.)<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople say to me you\u2019re on that Board but it\u2019s well known that the algorithms reward emotional content that polarises communities because that makes it more addictive. Well I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not \u2014 and I think as a board we\u2019re going to have to get to grips with that,&#8221; he went on to say. &#8220;Even if that takes many sessions with coders speaking very slowly so that we can understand what they\u2019re saying.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI do think our responsibility will be to understand what these machines are \u2014 the machines that are going in rather than the machines that are moderating,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat their metrics are.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Both witnesses raised another concern: That the kind of complex, nuanced moderation decisions the Board is making won\u2019t be able to scale &#8212; suggesting they\u2019re too specific to be able to generally inform AI-based moderation. Nor will they necessarily be able to be acted on by the staffed moderation system that Facebook currently operates (which gives its thousand of human moderators a fantastically tiny amount of thinking time per content decision).<\/p>\n<p>Despite that the issue of Facebook&#8217;s vast scale vs the Board&#8217;s limited and Facebook-defined function &#8212; to fiddle at the margins of its content empire &#8212; was one overarching point that hung uneasily over the session, without being properly grappled with.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think your question about &#8216;is this easily communicated&#8217; is a really good one that we\u2019re wrestling with a bit,\u201d Rusbridger said, conceding that he\u2019d had to brain up on a whole bunch of unfamiliar \u201chuman rights protocols and norms from around the world\u201d to feel qualified to rise to the demands of the review job.<\/p>\n<p>Scaling that level of training to the tens of thousands of moderators Facebook currently employs to carry out content moderation would of course be eye-wateringly expensive. Nor is it on offer from Facebook. Instead it&#8217;s hand-picked a crack team of 40 very expensive and learned experts to tackle an infinitesimally smaller number of content decisions.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s important that the decisions we come to are understandable by human moderators,&#8221; Rusbridger added. &#8220;Ideally they\u2019re understandable by machines as well \u2014 and there is a tension there because sometimes you look at the facts of a case and you decide it in a particular way with reference to those three standards [Facebook\u2019s community standard, Facebook\u2019s values and \u201ca human rights filter\u201d].

which only funds the startups it launches, just closed its newest fund with $260 million"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Jack Abraham has a lot of confidence in what he&#8217;s building. Then again, you can&#8217;t be immodest or unsure of yourself if you&#8217;re going to bet exclusively on your own startups as an investor, which is precisely the model that Abraham&#8217;s San Francisco-based venture studio, <a href=\"https:\/\/atomic.vc\/\">Atomic<strong>,<\/strong><\/a> has followed since it was launched nine years ago.<\/p>\n<p>It all started with $10 million of Abraham&#8217;s own money, capital he amassed by selling his first startup, a local shopping engine called Milo, to eBay in 2010, for $75 million. Abraham had dropped out of Wharton as an undergrad with $500,000 from a professor who believed that Abraham &#8212; whose father founded ComScore &#8212; would himself be a company-building machine.<\/p>\n<p>The professor had good instincts. After selling Milo at age 24, Abraham spent more than three years building products inside of eBay and learning how to lead multiple teams before beginning to look outward, making angel bets, including on Uber and Pinterest, and, he says, spreading around some of his ideas. (Among these, he says, he &#8220;invented Postmates. I gave the founders literally the idea for the company; they were working on a B2B company at the time. I was fairly early on there; that helped spawn the whole food delivery thing.&#8221;)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>He had so many ideas &#8212; hundreds, he says &#8212; that not long afterward, he created Atomic with cofounder Andrew Dudum, a Wharton peer who is also the son of entrepreneurs and who also <a href=\"https:\/\/thesign.al\/andrew-dudum-cofounder-partner-at-atomic-2\/\">dropped out of college<\/a> to join the startup world. (Dudum&#8217;s first stop was a then-nascent <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/TokBox\">startup<\/a> backed by Sequoia Capital.)<\/p>\n<p>At first, Atomic worked on one company. The following year, it worked on two. By 2018, the outfit had built out a team that could handle many of the back-end functions that startups need to thrive, from recruiting to accounting, and launched 10 companies. Impressed investors gave the firm $150 million to create even more startups.<\/p>\n<p>By then, Abraham and Dudum had brought in two other general partners: Chester Ng and Andrew Salamon. Salamon left in 2019 to launch his own venture studio, <a href=\"https:\/\/materialcompanies.com\/#team\">Material<\/a>, with Blue Apron founder Matt Salzberg. The same year, JD Ross, one of a handful of cofounders of the <a href=\"https:\/\/news.crunchbase.com\/news\/opendoor-closes-at-31-25-on-first-day-of-trading\/\">newly public<\/a> company Opendoor, joined Atomic as a general partner.<\/p>\n<p>The firm has only picked up speed since. Indeed, at this point, Atomic has created &#8220;dozens&#8221; of startups &#8212; including roughly one per month last year, says Abraham. It also just closed on $260 million in new capital commitments, including from a prominent university that now serves as its anchor investor but would prefer not to be named publicly.<\/p>\n<p>Citing &#8220;proprietary aspects&#8221; to the model, Abraham declines to explain how Atomic&#8217;s economics work, except to acknowledge that it operates in &#8220;more of a fund context instead of a holding company&#8221; where investors would essentially be buying stakes in Atomic itself.<\/p>\n<p>Certainly, it&#8217;s easy to appreciate the enthusiasm of Atomic&#8217;s investors, including early backers like Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen. Abraham and Dudum are both compelling storytellers, as we&#8217;ve witnessed first-hand in interviewing them at different times. The firm is also starting to see some exits.<\/p>\n<p>One of Atomic&#8217;s creations, the telehealth company Hims, was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/21\/telehealth-startup-hims-fell-in-its-public-trading-debut-and-thats-fine-with-its-ceo\/\">taken public<\/a> in January through a blank-check company in a deal that valued the company at $1.6 billion, and its shares have been rising since. As of this writing, the three-and-a-half-year-old outfit &#8212; run by Dudum, who is doing double-duty as Hims&#8217;s CEO and a general partner with Atomic &#8212; boasts a market cap of $2.9 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Atomic also sold a voice-powered sales startup, TalkIQ, to the company Dialpad in 2018 for what Forbes reported at the time to be a &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/alexkonrad\/2018\/05\/16\/dialpad-buys-talkiq\/?sh=4595ec8387d0\">little under $50 million<\/a>.&#8221; TalkIQ had raised $22 million altogether.<\/p>\n<p>More exits are coming, suggests Abraham. &#8220;There many companies we have that are now approaching the sort of growth and run rate where they have the ability to go public, even as soon as in the next year,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>One of those eventual prospects is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicant.ai\/\">Replicant<\/a>, an autonomous call center startup that has raised $35 million since its 2017 founding, including a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/kenrickcai\/2020\/09\/10\/replicant-series-a-call-center-voice-ai\/?sh=2b040a9d4266\">$27 million Series A round<\/a> led by Norwest Venture Partners back in September. Another Atomic startup, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.homebound.com\/\">Homebound<\/a>, a three-year-old home-building outfit that handles everything from financing to construction, has also enjoyed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/samanthasharf\/2020\/01\/16\/she-almost-lost-her-home-in-californias-wildfires-instead-she-built-a-200-million-business\">some momentum<\/a>, as well as attracted $53 million from investors.<\/p>\n<p>Though Atomic prides itself on &#8220;pressure testing&#8221; its ideas, not every startup has been a hit. A photo-sharing app called Ever was quickly shut down after <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/tech\/security\/millions-people-uploaded-photos-ever-app-then-company-used-them-n1003371\">NBC reported<\/a> that the photos people shared were used to train the company\u2019s facial recognition system. A sleep-tracking specialist, Rested, was also shut down.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, ZenReach, a Wi-Fi marketing company that had collected at least <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/zenreach\">$94 million<\/a> from investors through 2018, laid off<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/zenreach-lays-off-20-of-staff-following-co-founders-departure-1519952702\"> 20%<\/a> of its employees that same year. A CEO who&#8217;d been brought aboard by Abraham and who was previously an operating partner with Atomic, has since moved on to a role elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>If not all of its ideas set the world on fire, Atomic has no shortage of others.<\/p>\n<p>Asked about some of the areas where he sees the most opportunity to innovate, Abraham quickly ticks off &#8220;healthcare, finance, education, real estate, and other large industries where truthfully, when you&#8217;re inside them, you understand how broken they are, and they are broken up and down the entire stack.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You study them,&#8221; he says, &#8220;and then you wonder how is this possible this happened.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jack Abraham has a lot of confidence in what he&#8217;s building.

confronts outrage among its employees and the public for mishandling multiple decisions about its role in shaping public discourse, it is becoming clear that it cannot solve its conundrums without a major change in its business model. And a new model is readily available: for-benefit status.<\/p>\n<p>For decades, a misguided ideology has warped companies, economies and societies: that the sole purpose of corporations is to maximize short-term returns to one set of stakeholders &#8212; those who have bought shares. Neither law nor history requires this to be true.<\/p>\n<p>But shareholder value-maximization ideology has become cemented in far too much corporate practice at the expense of societal well-being. This is manifested in many ways: a slavish adherence to the judgment of the &#8220;market,&#8221; even when other social signals are more powerful; executives enriched by stock options; companies fearful of \u201cactivist investors\u201d who attack whenever stock prices fail to meet quarterly \u201cexpectations\u201d and often-frivolous shareholder lawsuits pushing for stock gains at all costs.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The pandemic, however, has accelerated an already-spreading recognition that shareholder value maximization is often a harmful choice &#8212; not by any means a moral imperative or even a fiduciary responsibility.<\/p>\n<p>Major institutions of capitalism are converging on a new vision for it. The 2019\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/opportunity.businessroundtable.org\/ourcommitment\/\">Business Roundtable CEO statement<\/a>\u00a0said that corporate strategy should benefit\u00a0<i>all<\/i> stakeholders \u2013 including shareholders, yes, but equally customers, employees, suppliers, and the communities in which companies operate. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink\u2019s recent annual letters assert new views of how that investment company, the world\u2019s largest, should invest the trillions it oversees.<\/p>\n<p>Fink\u2019s 2019 letter spelled out a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.blackrock.com\/americas-offshore\/2019-larry-fink-ceo-letter\">new vision for corporate purpose<\/a>; the subsequent 2020 and 2021 letters focused on business\u2019 responsibility around climate change, particularly in light of the pandemic. The <a href=\"https:\/\/bcorporation.net\/\">B Corporation<\/a>\u00a0and conscious capitalism movements are growing. The World Economic Forum is championing a \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fourthsector.org\/fsdi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fourth Sector<\/a>,\u201d combining purpose with profit. Business schools, facing student rebellions against a purely profit-maximizing curriculum, are rapidly changing what they teach.<\/p>\n<p>And with society under siege, many more businesses, including social media, are scrambling to seem like good corporate citizens. They have no choice.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook, for example, has doubled down on philanthropy and new efforts to combat misinformation, even as usage and share price soar. Platforms like WhatsApp (owned by Facebook) have become essential services to connect people whose physical ties have been abruptly severed during the global pandemic. Shelter-in-place has become, in many ways, shelter-in-Facebook-properties.<\/p>\n<p>But Facebook and its brethren remain fragile. Since the 2016 presidential election in the U.S., Facebook has faced governmental hearings and regulation, public uproar (#deleteFacebook), and huge fines for invading privacy and undermining democracy. These calls were amplified in the weeks following the January 6 Capitol riot. Separately, it faces allegations of bias, largely (though not entirely) from the political right. These have led to calls for the revocation or reform of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which grants it immunity from the actions of its users.<\/p>\n<p>A giant company that is simultaneously essential and pilloried is vulnerable. Just ask the ghosts of John D. Rockefeller and his fellow robber barons, whose huge monopolies industrialized America more than 100 years ago. Journalistic muckrakers and public outrage targeted them for their abusive practices until the government finally broke up their companies via antitrust legislation.<\/p>\n<p>Because Mark Zuckerberg maintains complete majority control of Facebook, he could unilaterally quell public opprobrium and fend off heavy-handed regulation singlehandedly by transforming Facebook into a new kind of business: a for-benefit corporation.<\/p>\n<p>Under the\u00a0<a href=\"&quot;https:\/\/benefitcorp.net\/businesses?\">Public Benefit Corporation<\/a> legal model, firms bind themselves to a public benefit mission statement and carry out required ongoing reporting on both the standard financials\u00a0<i>and<\/i>\u00a0on how the company is living up to its mission. That status protects the company against profit-demanding shareholder lawsuits, and also attracts employees and investors who want to combine profit with purpose.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/data.world\/\">Data.world<\/a> is one of the thousands of certified B Corporations that have seen good returns on financial metrics.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.allbirds.com\/\">Allbirds<\/a>, for example, launched in a few sustainable materials using a pro-sustainability process to manufacture comfortable shoes, quickly reaching revenues of $100 million and valuation of $1.7 billion in an industry fraught with sustainability and human rights concerns. Other household names that are B Corps include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thebodyshop.com\/en-us\/\">The Body Shop<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"&quot;https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/\">Coursera<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.danone.com\/\">Danone<\/a>, the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.jamieoliver.com\/\">Jamie Oliver Group<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.kingarthurbaking.com\/\">King Arthur Flour<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/numitea.com\/\">Numi Tea<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.patagonia.com\/home\/\">Patagonia<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Many companies that have not undergone formal B Certification from B Labs have nonetheless done well while transforming their business practices, such as the carpet and flooring company\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.interface.com\/\">Interface<\/a>. Some firms incorporate ESG principles into their management systems \u2013 the $24 billion (market cap) Dutch life sciences company\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dsm.com\/corporate\/home.html\">DSM<\/a> has for years had meaningful sustainability targets for its senior management that account for fully 50 percent of their annual bonuses. Both Interface and DSM attribute much of their commercial success to their attention to non-financial considerations.<\/p>\n<p>A for-benefit Facebook could similarly relate to the world differently, avoiding many of the reputational shocks and regulatory responses that have led to huge stock dips and enormous fines. Its operations would align with Zuckerberg\u2019s proclaimed purpose to enable the potential abundance that results from connecting everyone in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine a Facebook town hall as a true public square, not just another way to gather and sell people\u2019s data without their explicit consent. Imagine a Facebook that put its users first and its advertisers second; that revealed where ads came from; that\u00a0<i>earned<\/i>\u00a0your attention in a way that you controlled rather than through machine-driven algorithms maximizing your attention for good or ill. Such a for-benefit Facebook could create true buy-in and transparency with its massive community around the world.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, such steps as Facebook\u2019s new\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2020\/05\/welcoming-the-oversight-board\/\">Oversight Board<\/a>, which may provide some meaningful review, don\u2019t require a legal change. But if shareholders and employees continue to be rewarded primarily by the success of the problematic ad revenue model, a continuing conflict between private gain and public benefit makes it impossible to have confidence about what is happening behind the scenes. A shift to for-benefit incorporation and appropriate certification brings with it different performance metrics and accountability systems with <a href=\"https:\/\/bcorporation.net\/directory\/dataworld-inc\">public scores<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In changing Facebook into a for-benefit corporation, Zuckerberg could insulate himself against presidential rage while rehabilitating his reputation \u2014 and his company&#8217;s. It would likely create vast ripples both in Silicon Valley and beyond \u2014 and it might help transform capitalism itself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In changing Facebook into a for-benefit corporation, Mark Zuckerberg could insulate himself against presidential rage while rehabilitating his reputation \u2014 and his company&#8217;s.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574325,"featured_media":2120097,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"e06a1b4d-e613-3efb-a93c-ff68342e6cdf"},"categories":[25515,352,3457,20429],"tags":[8289,81819,341024],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/GettyImages-1131098651.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2NWUZLx","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[2119237,2119235],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2119149"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2119149"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2119149\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2120099,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2119149\/revisions\/2120099"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/ann-florini"},{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/brett-hurt"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2119149&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574325"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2120097"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2119149"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2119149"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2119149"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2119149"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2119149"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2119149"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2119149"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":2119237,"name":"Ann Florini","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/ann-florini\/","description":"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ann-florini-5a25a327\">Ann Florini<\/a> is Clinical Professor at Thunderbird School of Global Management at the Arizona State University.","slug":"ann-florini","links":{"twitter":""},"position":"Contributor","cbDescription":"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ann-florini-5a25a327\">Ann Florini<\/a> is Clinical Professor at Thunderbird School of Global Management at the Arizona State University.","cbAvatar":"","twitter":""},{"id":2119235,"name":"Brett Hurt","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/brett-hurt\/","description":"Brett Hurt is CEO and co-founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/data.world\/\">Data.World<\/a>.","slug":"brett-hurt","links":{"twitter":"databrett"},"position":"Contributor","cbDescription":"Brett Hurt is CEO and co-founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/data.world\/\">Data.World<\/a>.","cbAvatar":"","twitter":"databrett"}],"author":[{"id":133574325,"name":"Walter Thompson","url":"https:\/\/anchor.fm\/thegoldencity","description":"Senior Editor Walter Thompson manages Extra Crunch and TechCrunch's guest post program. \r\n\r\nPreviously, he worked at a number of startups in various roles and as City Editor of Hoodline.

office environment and take up a remote-first strategy. Through necessity, professionals have adapted to remote working. But the systems they use are still playing catch up.<\/p>\n<p>One area less readily accommodating to the remote environment is the onboarding process. Given that it is the first sustained contact that a new starter has with a company, a remote-first strategy is dependent on its success. When looking to onboard new employees, the luxuries of first-day meet and greets, in-person hardware setup and a team lunch are no longer available. From interview to offer letter and beyond, any new hire\u2019s early journey is critical to their life at the company, their job satisfaction and ultimately their productivity. The remote induction must be a smooth process, and so needs a thorough rethink.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tWhat is most important is that everyone in an organization prioritizes documentation; exactly how they do it is secondary.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>A cultural shift in the company may be necessary. Organizations need to embrace knowledge sharing and collaboration, by turning to a \u201chandbook-first\u201d approach. A few simple steps can lead them there. Companies also need to analyze their workflow. Are the right systems in place to ensure the seamless flow of both tacit and explicit knowledge?<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps most importantly, artificial intelligence can help transform a clunky old onboarding process into a sophisticated, smooth journey. Naturally the best AI models to use will depend on the business and department in question. However, with a few pointers business leaders can carve out a path to AI integration.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s dive into the specifics that can transform the remote onboarding process, for the benefit of both the company and the new starter in question.<\/p>\n<h2>How to handbook<\/h2>\n<p>This is arguably the most important piece of the puzzle when it comes to ensuring newcomers are able to access the right information at the right time; it\u2019s also the most difficult to get right. It is for workers at all levels of an organization to think about how knowledge is shared between teams and the processes that surround that interchange of ideas.<\/p>\n<p>What is most important is that everyone in an organization prioritizes documentation; exactly how they do it is secondary. You can spin up plenty of free and paid software to start creating a handbook. Anything cloud-based is suitable, with more sophisticated paid options recommended to keep things easily searchable with documentation sorted into well-defined hierarchies rather than losing those nuggets of information in a sea of folders.<\/p>\n<p>However, this systemic challenge is best addressed from top down. The process should include some checks and balances, with permissioning crucial for parts of the handbook that should remain static, like policies and SLPs. Other parts of the documentation should be kept flexible, like processes and team-level knowledge. The majority of the handbook must be democratized as far as possible.<\/p>\n<p>GitLab, an all-remote company, first coined the term \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/about.gitlab.com\/company\/culture\/all-remote\/handbook-first-documentation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/about.gitlab.com\/company\/culture\/all-remote\/handbook-first-documentation\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614737496741000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGFhlfE0KHZppGd_ViK-6D4WllGrg\">handbook-first<\/a>.\u201d The DevOps software provider acts as a great example of a company that lives and breathes through documenting and codifying internal knowledge. Everyone within the organization buys into the mantra of documenting what they know, with subject matter experts assigned to manage knowledge base content. Keeping company documentation up to date is a collaborative task, considered paramount to the company&#8217;s livelihood. Software gives a helping hand, nudging contributors to keep information up to date.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/darrenmurph\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/darrenmurph\/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614737496741000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH6PyfIw83sLW8kVNSdhSEMQCHNZg\">Darren Murph<\/a>, head of Remote at GitLab, says that their documentation strategy, twinned with a cooperative approach, helps to build trust with new starters. \u201cWhen everything a new hire needs to know is written down, there&#8217;s no ambiguity or wondering if something is missing.

first paying moon flight customer wants to give away eight seats aboard his spaceship"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Yusaku Maezawa, the first paying passenger to book a trip aboard SpaceX&#8217;s (still in development) Starship spacecraft around the moon, has provided a promised update about his mission. It&#8217;s still aiming for 2023 for a flight date, and the plan is still to fly a week-long trip around the moon and back. Now, however, Maezawa is <a href=\"https:\/\/dearmoon.earth\">looking for crewmates<\/a>. The full passenger list will include 10 to 12 crew members, Maezawa said in a video about the announcement, but eight will be selected from the general public.<\/p>\n<p>Back when the mission was first announced in 2018, Maezawa said that he wanted to bring between six and eight artists with him as co-astronauts, in order to inspire them to create art based on the experience. That approach has changed somewhat, since he says that he realized anyone who expresses any kind of creativity could be considered an artist. There&#8217;s now two criteria for the selection: First, that you can excel at what you do by going to space, and second, that you can support the rest of the crew on the trip.<\/p>\n<p>Maezawa, a billionaire, serial entrepreneur and an artist himself, has paid for the entire trip himself, including the eight passenger seats that he announced today he&#8217;d be giving away for free.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/h_L3wLmrMuA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Maezawa also detailed in a new site the process for selecting the crew members. It includes pre-registration, which closes on March 14, and then moves into a screening process that ends on March 21. There&#8217;s an assignment of some kind that applicants need to complete by March 21, and then there&#8217;s an online interview component, followed by final interviews and medical screening to take place late in May.<\/p>\n<p>All of the above timeline is subject to change, according to the application microsite. But once the team is selected, 2022 and 2023 will be focused on training in preparation for the flight. There&#8217;s also now a rough flight plan for the mission, which you can see in the graphic below. It&#8217;s not too detailed, but does include timestamps and a visual that shows the intended course will indeed loop around the moon and then return.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2120024\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2120024\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2120024\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/schedule_1_pc.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"664\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/schedule_1_pc.png 2460w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/schedule_1_pc.png?resize=150,97 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/schedule_1_pc.png?resize=300,195 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/schedule_1_pc.png?resize=768,498 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/schedule_1_pc.png?resize=680,441 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/schedule_1_pc.png?resize=1536,997 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/schedule_1_pc.png?resize=2048,1329 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/schedule_1_pc.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2120024\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> dearMoon<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>One thing that&#8217;s notably absent from this call for passenger applications is the ill-advised and definitely creepy call for applicants to be Maezawa&#8217;s &#8220;life partner.&#8221; He made the ask in 2020, seeking single women older than 20 to apply to a &#8220;match-making&#8221; from which he would choose one romantic potential to join him on the trip, and star in a documentary about the process.

This whole world of NFTs is super new to me (I&#8217;ve only been using Top Shot for a couple of weeks now) so I caught up with a couple of NFT creators to break it down for me, as well as share some insights on where they think the space is going, and it&#8217;s overall potential.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The way I like to explain NFTs, they are digital assets with true ownership and provenance,&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/makersplace.com\/richardrivera\/\">Ronin the Collector <\/a>told TechCrunch. &#8220;You can track their origin and they can only be owned by one person.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Many people, myself included, at some point wonder why someone would pay for a short video clip of, for example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbatopshot.com\/moment\/mrd+ee07ddae-7658-4c39-93ca-b01643e0e814?\">Stephen Curry making a three-pointer<\/a> when you download it to your computer for free.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Humans inherently, whether we will like to admit it or not, want to own things,&#8221; Ronin said. &#8220;And I think that that&#8217;s part of the human experience is owning things. When you own things, it&#8217;s a connection, and it&#8217;s like you have reason for being and there&#8217;s something unique about ownership. And I think that at the end of the day, yeah, you can you can watch it all you want. But can you sell it?&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is the one!

As an example, one user bought a LeBron James dunk for $208,000 a couple of weeks ago, <a href=\"https:\/\/cryptoslam.io\/nba-top-shot\/sales\">according to CryptoSlam<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.nbatopshot.com\/posts\/state-of-nba-topshot?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=stateofnbatopshot_blog\">Last month<\/a>, Top Shot reached nearly $50 million in marketplace transactions. Then, over a 24-hour period last week, Top Shot saw more than $37 million in sales, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cryptoslam.io\/nba-top-shot\">according to Cryptoslam<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>As to why they&#8217;re blowing up right now, Ronin attributes it to a couple of things: the pandemic that&#8217;s forced everyone behind a computer screen and an easy entry point. Top Shot, for example, makes it super easy for plebeians like me to sign up and you don&#8217;t need to have a crypto wallet. You can just use your credit card. The same goes for Nifty Gateway.<\/p>\n<p>But Top Shot and Nifty are outliers, Ronin said. For the majority of NFT platforms, you need to have an Ethereum wallet. As Cooper Turley, crypto strategy lead at Audius, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/27\/if-you-havent-followed-nfts-heres-why-you-should-start\/\">wrote on TC<\/a>, &#8220;this means collectors need to purchase ETH from an exchange like Coinbase and send it to a non-custodial address that consists of a long string of numbers and letters to get started.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That sounds like a whole thing that I, for one, am not ready to dive into. In general, barriers to access continue to be a problem in the NFTs space, Ronin said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Projects are just now starting to pay attention to the user experience,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And just barely in time. One of the best rooms I&#8217;ve been on Clubhouse was one that talked about how basically, with the whole world watching, how do we not mess this up. So I think when you have a product like Top Shot, which is easy to get into, easy to sign up for, and easy to purchase. You have to use a credit card, you don&#8217;t need crypto and throw in the mix that everyone&#8217;s online and then <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/02\/24\/arts\/design\/christies-beeple-auction-blockchain-art.html\">Beeple sells $3 million worth of digital art<\/a>, and all of a sudden, people want to pay attention. So I think that was the catalyst.&#8221;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>But an even more expansive and interesting arena for NFTs than Top Shot is the world of NFT art. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sirsuhayb\">Ameer Carter<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/iamsirsu.com\/cryptomedia\">an artist<\/a> that is also known as Sirsu, got into NFTs last summer thanks to a friend, he told TechCrunch. Pretty much immediately, he said, he realized the transformative nature of the technology.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We literally have creative immortality,&#8221; he told me he realized at the time.<\/p>\n<p>But the art world has historically been inhospitable to Black folks and people of color, and especially in the world of NFTs, Carter said. The traditional art scene, Carter said, is elitist. And while Carter himself is a classically trained artist, he hasn&#8217;t been able to make his way into the traditional art world, he said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s not because of lack of trying,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Carter said he&#8217;s had a number of conversations with art curators who all love his work, but they&#8217;ve told him it&#8217;s not &#8220;something that they could build a whole curriculum around and intellectualize,&#8221; he said. What NFTs do is enable artists like Carter to create and share their art in a way that hadn&#8217;t previously been afforded to them.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">SIRSU Trading Card Series, &quot;Androinomicon&quot; explores themes of human nature through alliteration and android motifs. <\/p>\n<p>Pack two: Pile \/ Push \/ Pull.<br \/>27 remaining! <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/XwmA04W01J\">pic.twitter.com\/XwmA04W01J<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; (vain) sirsu.eth (@sirsuhayb) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sirsuhayb\/status\/1354304148259409921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 27, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;And this is a much more open and accessible platform, and environment for them to do so,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;And so my goal is to help really give them that type of visibility and empower them to be creatives. My mission is to remove the starving artists stigma. I don&#8217;t believe that creativity is cheap. I believe that it is rich. And it enriches and it gives us the reasons why we live in the first place.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>However, Carter said he&#8217;s begun to notice white folks taking credit for things Black artists have already done.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s this push and pull between folks who are really about the provenance of the blockchain versus folks who are wanting to predispose themselves as first because they have more visibility,&#8221; Carter said.<\/p>\n<p>He pointed to Black artists like <a href=\"https:\/\/danky.art\/portfolio\">Connie Digital<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/app.rarible.com\/harrisonfirst\">Harrison First<\/a> and others who were some of the first people to institute social tokens for their fans on the blockchain.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They were some of the first to deploy and sell albums as NFTs, EPs as NFTs, singular songs,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;And now we have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.globenewswire.com\/news-release\/2021\/02\/17\/2177446\/0\/en\/Acclaimed-Musician-3LAU-Launches-First-NFT-Album-on-Origin-s-Dshop.html\">Blau<\/a> that came out and people were saying he&#8217;s the first to sell an album. And it&#8217;s like, well, that&#8217;s not true, technically. But what works and has continued to work is because there&#8217;s a lot of hoopla and a lot of money around that sale, that becomes the formative thing as being first because it&#8217;s the one that&#8217;s made the most noise. And I find it interesting because of the fact that we can literally go back tangibly, and there&#8217;s verifiable hash proof that it wasn&#8217;t the case.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>These are the types of phenomena pushing Carter to become an NFT archivist of sorts, he said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not necessarily a historian, but I think the more and more I get involved in this space, the more and more I feel that pressing role of being an archivist,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So that culturally, we aren&#8217;t erased, even in a space that&#8217;s supposed to be decentralized and supposed to be something that works for everyone.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s partly why Carter is building The Well to archive the work of Black artists, like <a href=\"https:\/\/linktr.ee\/blacksneakers\">Blacksneakers<\/a>, for example. The Well will also be a platform for Black artists to mint their NFTs in a place that feels safe, supportive and not exploitative, he said.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2119426\" style=\"width: 1235px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2119426\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout wp-image-2119426 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-5.25.17-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1225\" height=\"656\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-5.25.17-PM.png 1225w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-5.25.17-PM.png?resize=150,80 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-5.25.17-PM.png?resize=300,161 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-5.25.17-PM.png?resize=768,411 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-5.25.17-PM.png?resize=680,364 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/02\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-5.25.17-PM.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1225px) 100vw, 1225px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2119426\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/superrare.co\/artwork-v2\/in-the-summer,-i-wish-to-be-with-you-13409\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Black Sneakers via SuperRare <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>On current platforms, Carter said it feels like white artists generally get more promotions on the site, as well as on social media, than Black artists.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They deserve to have that kind of artists&#8217; growth and development,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;Yet it is afforded to a lot of other artists that don&#8217;t look like them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Carter said he recognizes it&#8217;s not the responsibility of platforms like Nifty Gateway, SuperRare and others to provide opportunities to Black artists, but that they do have the ability to put Black artists in a better position to receive opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s partly what Carter hopes to achieve with <a href=\"https:\/\/ownthewell.com\/\">The Well Protocol.<\/a> The Well, which Carter plans to launch on Juneteenth, aims to create an inclusive platform and ecosystem for NFT artists, collectors and curators. Carter said he wants artists to not have to feel like they have to constantly leverage Twitter to showcase their work. Instead, they&#8217;ll have the full backing of an ecosystem pumping up their work.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Everywhere else, you look at other artists and they have write-ups, and they have news coverage and things of that nature,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;And [Black artists] don&#8217;t have a lot of those avenues to compete. You know, I&#8217;m in the business of building true equity for us, so part and parcel to that is developing the tools and the ecosystem for us to thrive.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>No longer should art just be for the rich, Carter said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have the ability to completely dismantle that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So we have to be very, very, very careful about that and make a concerted effort to make that thing work, but we can&#8217;t do it when we have folks entering the space with money erasing folks who were already here. We can&#8217;t have that where platforms are not allowing the positioning of artists to grow. You know, we can&#8217;t have that when we have folks by and large, fear mongering and trying to get other artists to not be a part of this system.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also important, he said, for NFTs to not solely be seen as collectible, investable objects.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Everyone&#8217;s getting into the game like it&#8217;s a money grab,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s playing with artists lives and careers here.&#8221;<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>For those who aren&#8217;t yet in on NFTs, there&#8217;s still time, Ronin said. Even with the increased attention on NFTs, Ronin says it&#8217;s still early days.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Honestly, I don&#8217;t even think we&#8217;ve got a full foot into early adoption yet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you come out of early adoption until we&#8217;ve got a solid experience across the board. I think we&#8217;re still in alpha.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s partly because Ronin believes the things people will be able to do in five or ten years with this technology will pale in comparison to what&#8217;s happening today. For example, Ronin said he spoke with an artist who is experimenting with an NFT experience that will transcend VR, AR and XR.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m so excited that she chose to work with me and bring me in on this, and use me as kind of an advisor,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And she can change the world with this technology.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s really what&#8217;s so exciting about NFTs for Ronin &#8212; the notion that the technology can change your life, and the world, he said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And it is a space in which you should feel free to come into and dream big and then figure out how to make those dreams happen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can use AR, VR, mobile, you know, the internet &#8212; you can use all these aspects and create an NFT experience that transcends space, transcends time, transcends our life. So it&#8217;s a super powerful technology. And I think that people should really pay attention.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Down the road, Ronin also envisions having connected blockchains &#8220;where you can take an NFT from, you know, Bitcoin to Ethereum to <a href=\"https:\/\/on.wax.io\/wax-io\/\">WAX<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.onflow.org\/\">Flow,<\/a>&#8221; he said. &#8220;I really think that it&#8217;s why this this is that important.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>For Carter, he hopes his work at The Well will help to set a precedent for inclusivity and access in the NFT space. It&#8217;s worth mentioning that Carter is also working on the <a href=\"https:\/\/mint.af\/\">Mint Fund<\/a> to help minimize the barriers to entry for artists looking to mint their first NFTs. Minting an NFT can be expensive to the tune of $50-$250 depending on how busy the Ethereum network is, and Mint Fund will pay those fees for new artists, making the on-ramp into the world smoother.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If we don&#8217;t do this the right way with the right type of community-driven thinking, then we will lose,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s not going to look good, it&#8217;s going to be ugly. And it&#8217;s going to again perpetuate the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer&#8230;We have to find the best ways to redistribute wealth at any given point in time within this economy, within this system. If we do not know how to do that, we are fucked. At least in my opinion.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There are also conversations in the space around the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loop-news.com\/p\/the-big-problem-with-nfts-energy\">ecological impact of minting NFTs<\/a>, which requires a good amount of energy to do. Carter described the existence of two camps: the camp arguing minting NFTs are very ecologically damaging and the ones saying it&#8217;s not the fault of minters and you can&#8217;t blame them &#8220;for minting on a system that is already going to process these transactions, whether they mint or not.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>For Carter, he thinks the first camp could be right, but says there&#8217;s just a lot of yelling at this point.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that collectively, us as minters should not feel so fucked up that we can&#8217;t do anything anymore,&#8221; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Carter also pointed to the energy required to print and ship a bunch of his work.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To sell one piece of art that I&#8217;ve minted versus the energy expenditure and the emissions it takes for me to sell, let&#8217;s say 1,000 prints at $20,&#8221; he said. &#8220;To now shop those to 1,000 different places and for those things to then be transported to 1,000 different homes. Like, maybe they&#8217;re comparable, maybe they&#8217;re not. I&#8217;m not too interested in doing the math at this point.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, Carter thinks there needs to be better access to renewable energy sources and more innovative hardware in the space.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And the production of creating that innovative hardware also has to be coming from renewable energy sources, like the entire framework should be working to be carbon negative,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As carbon neutral to carbon negative as possible. And not just the minting side but the mining side. And, you know, the manufacturing side. It&#8217;s a cyclical issue.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Digital collectibles are having a very large moment.

emergency responders to begin planning out how to confront the increasingly complex and unwieldy task of preventing and responding to fires in the American West. Wildfires in the region have been particularly acute in recent years in states like California, mostly due to hotter conditions driven by climate change, decaying grid infrastructure that can lead to sparks, and a tinderbox of trees and foliage ripe for conflagration.<\/p>\n<p>After years of bruising firefighting, some startups are exploring how to improve fire response. One of them is <a href=\"https:\/\/cornea.is\">Cornea<\/a>, a sort of spin-up by public sector-focused venture studio <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hangar.is\/\">Hangar<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/19\/hangar-raises-15-million-for-its-venture-studio-for-government-technology-startups\/\">which raised $15 million last year<\/a> to build new startups targeting the government.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"0D5r5StFqE\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/19\/hangar-raises-15-million-for-its-venture-studio-for-government-technology-startups\/\">Hangar raises $15 million for its venture studio for government technology startups<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Hangar raises $15 million for its venture studio for government technology startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/08\/19\/hangar-raises-15-million-for-its-venture-studio-for-government-technology-startups\/embed\/#?secret=0D5r5StFqE\" data-secret=\"0D5r5StFqE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>One of Hangar\u2019s first companies was Cornea back a couple of years ago, and it remains one of the most interesting for its potential. The idea is to meld geographical, weather and historical fire data into a machine learning model that can augment frontline firefighters with better guidance on where to push forward and when to retreat in the midst of a blaze.<\/p>\n<p>The startup has two main products it is looking to launch this year. The first is focused around delivering better situational awareness around a subject known among firefighters as the \u201cSuppression Difficulty Index.\u201d These are essentially maps that inform firefighters of the dangers of fighting fire in a very specific geographical location. For instance, a particular location could have wind or water conditions that might accelerate a fire and endanger responders if they are not careful.<\/p>\n<p>The other product is focused on \u201cPotential Control Lines\u201d \u2014 locations where a fire break or other action could potentially push back a fire. Using typography, vegetation and a myriad of other data, Cornea can locate positions with a higher likelihood of success in battling a fire.<\/p>\n<p>Cornea\u2019s Chief Fire Officer is Tom Harbour, who formerly served a decade as head of fire response for the U.S. Forest Service. He said that \u201c50 years ago, I was raised in a culture where you never knew \u2018why\u2019 \u2014 you just obeyed orders\u201d when it came to firefighting decisions out in the field. \u201cYour head was on the proverbial swivel.\u201d With Cornea and the products the company is creating, we are \u201cGetting aligned on the \u2018why\u2019 and beginning to have [firefighters] sense the information that they are looking at.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Harbour noted that the most common tools in the field today remain paper maps and markers, simply because \u201cyou know it doesn\u2019t break right at the time when you can\u2019t have things break.\u201d Cornea\u2019s products may help firefighters in the field, but they are far more likely to have an impact in the fire operations centers where strategic decisions get made about where to invest firefighting resources.<\/p>\n<p>Josh Mendelsohn, the founder and managing partner of Hangar, said that the company is straight down the center of the studio\u2019s investment thesis. \u201cCornea is focused on taking these large datasets, processing them effectively \u2026 and then giving [firefighters] as much analytical impact in an output as simple as possible,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cit turns out that in this market the best user experience is a PDF.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, one of the major challenges for building in this market is simply the unique dynamic of disaster response compared to, say, enterprise SaaS. \u201cCornea has had to go through a customer-discovery process,\u201d Mendelsohn said. \u201cIt all feels necessary, but what are the right things that require the least amount of behavior change to have impact immediately?\u201d One challenge particularly around firefighting is simply the feedback loop from the field to the team. \u201cFire is seasonal so we have had to be a bit incremental,\u201d Mendelsohn said.<\/p>\n<p>The team is currently three full-time people plus consultants with Hangar augmenting them with its own studio staff. The company built out its product partially using federal research grants to deepen the science of firefighting, and this year, hopes to work with the Forest Service and state firefighting agencies to get its models out to the frontlines. \u201cThere is a human bandwidth problem,\u201d Mendelsohn said. \u201cHow do you take limited resources to help [firefighters] go further by using them effectively?\u201d<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"3hg2UfuVO9\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/02\/silicon-valleys-myths-and-realities-of-existential-risk\/\">Silicon Valley\u2019s myths and realities of existential risk<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Silicon Valley\u2019s myths and realities of existential risk&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/02\/silicon-valleys-myths-and-realities-of-existential-risk\/embed\/#?secret=3hg2UfuVO9\" data-secret=\"3hg2UfuVO9\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/26\/techcrunch-early-stage-is-the-startup-bootcamp-youve-always-needed\/?tpcc=ECTW2020\">Early Stage<\/a> is the premier \u2018how-to\u2019 event for startup entrepreneurs and investors.

Still, the pro-union wing has seemingly found an ally in Joe Biden, who recently commented, \u201cThe choice to join a union is up to the workers, full stop.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In May, Glitch laid off 18 &#8212; amounting to around a third of the staff. CEO Anil Dash noted at the time, \u201cwe are a small company in a fiercely competitive space in a tough economy. But these good people have done immensely valuable work that our entire team and community are grateful for.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The agreement, which holds for 11 months, focuses &#8212; in part &#8212; on the rights of those impacted workers, detailing severance and rehiring those former employees if their former positions are re-instated.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is an absolutely historic win for us,\u201d said software engineer Katie Lundsgaard. \u201cWe love our jobs, we love working at Glitch, which is why we wanted to ensure we have a lasting voice at this company and lasting protections. This contract does that, and I hope tech workers across the industry can see that unions and startups are not incompatible.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Organizers add:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The contract also does not focus on wages and benefits, which are already generous at Glitch, opting instead to ensure basic union protections for workers and a continued voice in the workplace.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"tua3Kx4gtZ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/13\/online-code-collaboration-tool-glitch-votes-to-unionize\/\">Online code collaboration tool Glitch votes to unionize<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Online code collaboration tool Glitch votes to unionize&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/13\/online-code-collaboration-tool-glitch-votes-to-unionize\/embed\/#?secret=tua3Kx4gtZ\" data-secret=\"tua3Kx4gtZ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/26\/techcrunch-early-stage-is-the-startup-bootcamp-youve-always-needed\/?tpcc=ECTW2020\">Early Stage<\/a> is the premier \u2018how-to\u2019 event for startup entrepreneurs and investors.

Existing Doma shareholder Lennar has also committed to the PIPE and Spencer Rascoff, co-founder and former CEO of Zillow Group, has committed a personal investment to the PIPE.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to approximately $510 million of cash proceeds are expected to be retained by Doma, and existing Doma shareholders will own no less than approximately 80 percent of the equity of the new combined company, subject to redemptions by the public stockholders of Capitol and payment of transaction expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In mid-February, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doma announced it had <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/17\/heres-why-these-startups-chose-to-raise-debt-instead-of-equity\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">closed on $150 million in debt financing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hudsonstructured.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> HSCM Bermuda<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which had previously invested in the company.

After removing premiums paid to agents, its revenues (&#8220;retained premiums and fees&#8221;) decreased to $179.8 million in 2019 and $189.7 million in 2020. (For this section we&#8217;re leaning on the reported 2020 numbers that are caveated with an &#8220;estimated&#8221; tag. As it is March, we expect the final 2020 numbers to come in close enough to what was reported as to make us comfortable citing them.)<\/p>\n<p>In 2021 the company also anticipates modest growth, with GAAP revenues estimated at $416.4 million, and its retained revenue figure landing at $226.4 million. More expansive growth is anticipated and sketched out for 2022 and 2023, though as those figures are far in the future we can discount them for now.<\/p>\n<p>Doma also expects its economics to worsen in 2021, with its adjusted gross profit as a percentage of its retained premiums and fees falling from 48.3% last year to 39.5% this year. Of course we&#8217;re so far off the GAAP ranch with that metric as to be lost, but it&#8217;s worth noting what the company is telling the street about its impending financial performance.<\/p>\n<p>Other metrics are also pointed in a negative direction, with Doma expecting its adjusted EBITDA to fall from -$19.0 million to -$66.6 million in 2021. The company does predict a rosy 2023 adjusted EBITDA number, for whatever stock you want to put in that.<\/p>\n<p>Without discounting costs, Doma&#8217;s 2020 net loss of $35.1 million is expected to expand to $103.1 million this year. Still, as with many entities pursuing a public debut via a SPAC, Doma is debuting while it is still sorting out elements of its business as the pandemic starts to diminish in light of increasingly readily available vaccines. It certainly has high hopes for its future.<\/p>\n<h2>The SPAC parade<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doma joins the growing number of proptech companies going the public route.

Penske, Ryder and U-Haul.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now, it has the capital to help it get there. The Denver-based company said Tuesday it raised <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$63 million in a Series A funding round to expand its truck-sharing platform, which helps mid-mile and last-mile delivery companies remotely manage an on-demand rental fleet via web or mobile app. Private equity firm Bison Capital led the round, with participation from Ingka Investments (part of Ingka Group, the main Ikea retailer), Sumitomo Corporation of Americas and Fluid Vehicle Owners.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The investment, its first external round, comes after rapid growth at the four-year-old company. Founder and CEO James Eberhard told TechCrunch that revenue increased 100x in the last two years. That type of growth sounds promising, but the company did not provide a baseline, so it\u2019s hard to judge scale.\u00a0<\/span><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With e-commerce expected to continue to rise at a global 9.5% compound annual growth rate from 2020 to 2025, the demand for accessible trucks for hire might see correlative growth.

B<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">usinesses such as moving and e-commerce delivery companies can use the platform to rent trucks. Fluid Truck&#8217;s pitch to businesses extends beyond the &#8220;you don&#8217;t need to buy or lease&#8221; argument. The platform also <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">allows delivery companies to dispense with having a manager on staff who would manage, maintain and eventually sell the fleet.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses eager to outsource the purchasing and managing of their trucks can find fleets for hire in industrial parks and retail areas within Fluid\u2019s service network.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou can hop on our platform, rent a truck and be in it in a matter of minutes, which really allows businesses to scale up and scale down,\u201d said Eberhard. \u201cWe\u2019re watching our user behavior go from a place where they used to own every vehicle they needed at a time to a place where they\u2019re now grabbing spare capacity off Fluid.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eberhard hopes to see that type of supplementary use morph into an end state where companies don\u2019t own a single truck and run solely on Fluid Truck\u2019s platform.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fluid Truck argues that its tech stack, which is designed to smooth out the booking and renting process, gives it a competitive edge in a market dominated by the likes of U-Haul, Ryder and or other small depots. Eberhard said the process of going to a depot and waiting in line is slow and sloppy, whereas Fluid Truck\u2019s app makes renting a van as easy as calling an Uber.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe take all those complexities away and allow people to have a virtual fleet,\u201d Eberhard told TechCrunch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fluid Truck\u2019s fleet is made up of thousands \u2014 and soon to be tens of thousands \u2014 of cargo vans, pickup trucks, large box trucks and various other vehicles. The company also claims to have the largest medium-duty EV rental fleet in the United States, which it continues to expand as it works with OEMs to increase fleet capacity. Electric vehicles still make up less than 1% of its total portfolio due <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to the slower adoption of EVs on the commercial side.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eberhard wants Fluid to be a dominant force in the trucking industry. But Fluid Truck is not the only truck sharing app on the streets. Competitors GoShare and Bungii have similar offerings.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"iqRA5XXU4S\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/05\/electric-scooter-company-gogoro-launches-goshare-an-end-to-end-vehicle-sharing-platform\/\">Smart scooter company Gogoro launches GoShare, an end-to-end vehicle-sharing platform<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Smart scooter company Gogoro launches GoShare, an end-to-end vehicle-sharing platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/05\/electric-scooter-company-gogoro-launches-goshare-an-end-to-end-vehicle-sharing-platform\/embed\/#?secret=iqRA5XXU4S\" data-secret=\"iqRA5XXU4S\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This sizable round could provide an advantage as it tries to become the household name in digital truck sharing.

During this live chat, Twitter confirmed that Spaces would arrive on Android in March.<\/p>\n<p>It also <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TwitterSpaces\/status\/1365114929565597705\">promised a fix to how it displays listeners<\/a>, which has since rolled out.<\/p>\n<p>Other Spaces features are being shared in public as they&#8217;re designed and prototyped, including things like <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mayagpatterson\/status\/1364647741641527296\">titles and descriptions<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mayagpatterson\/status\/1365443249389793282\">scheduling options<\/a>, support for <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/c_at_work\/status\/1365431726550343680\">co-hosts and moderators<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/mayagpatterson\/status\/1365836725751148545\">guest lists<\/a>, and more.

Today, Clubhouse remains iOS-only in addition to being invite-only.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also indicative of the resources Twitter is putting into this new product, which was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/17\/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival\/\">first announced publicly<\/a> just in November. Clearly, Twitter believes social audio is a market it needs to win.<\/p>\n<p>The company also sees the broader potential for Spaces as being a key part of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/27\/this-week-in-apps-twitter-targets-creators-clubhouse-security-spotifys-plans-for-paid-podcasts\/\">a larger creator platform<\/a> now in the works.

is the latest health tech startup to raise millions in the musculoskeletal space"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">SpineZone is a startup that creates personalized exercise programs and treatment for neck and back pain. The company uses an online platform and in-person clinics to deliver a curriculum that, ideally, helps patients avoid the need for prescription drugs, injections and surgeries, and providers then avoid the cost of all of the above. Co-founded by brothers Kian Raiszadeh and Kamshad Raiszadeh, the company tells TechCrunch that it has raised $12 million in a Series A round led by Polaris Partners and Providence Ventures, with participation from Martin Ventures.<\/p>\n<p>At its core, SpineZone is a virtual physical therapy platform augmented by in-person clinics. The latter bit is important because it takes a video repository, which has health outcomes baked into it, and helps get those same users some real-life support.<\/p>\n<p>Patients can log onto the site, either through smartphone or laptop, and then answer a series of questions around pain and risk factors. Then, patients can go through a series of exercises. These exercises are created in tandem with professionals, and are based on peer-reviewed and evidence-based articles on musculoskeletal health.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Beyond this digital archive of videos, SpineZone offers an in-person clinic option to help patients practice these exercises. Off of this strategy, the startup claims that it has \u201c1 million lives under management.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>SpineZone\u2019s value proposition is that it helps payers and providers, whether that be employers, clinics or health plans such as Cigna or Aetna, avoid placing their patients in surgeries, which are expensive. By taking care of pain issues before they bubble up, SpineZone says that its current partners have been able to have a 50% reduction in surgery rate (it\u2019s worth noting that COVID-19 could also play a role in this because it is high-risk to enter a medical facility).<\/p>\n<p>Partners are happy because footing the bill of a non-operative procedure is remarkably cheaper than a non-operative procedure.<\/p>\n<p>The cost saving that a medical center could endure can be in the millions. For example, the Sharp Community Medical Group saved $3.4 million in cost savings after working with SpineZone for two years.<\/p>\n<p>SpineZone\u2019s business model is a smidge more complicated than your classic SaaS fee. For example, it charges a clinic based on the number of members it serves per month, and also shares in the downside. For example, if SpineZone promises to get a clinic to $12 million in spend from $15 million, and the cost ends up being $17 million, the company will pay the clinic a portion of the difference. Alternatively, if SpineZone got the clinic to $10 million, even below estimates, it shares in the upside.<\/p>\n<p>SpineZone joins a cohort of health tech startups that focus on musculoskeletal conditions. Venture-backed competitors include Peerwell, Force Therapeutics and Hinge Health, which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/05\/hinge-healthy-d\/\">was most recently valued at $3 billion, with plans to go public.<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ECjZ5wHyTY\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/05\/hinge-healthy-d\/\">Sources: Hinge Health has raised $300M Series D at a $3B valuation<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Sources: Hinge Health has raised $300M Series D at a $3B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/05\/hinge-healthy-d\/embed\/#?secret=ECjZ5wHyTY\" data-secret=\"ECjZ5wHyTY\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>In order to win, many startups, SpineZone including, need value-based care to replace fee-for-service care. Value-based care is the idea that doctors are paid for outcomes instead of the number of times you enter a doctor\u2019s office. The end goal is that this format creates monetary incentives around getting to an outcome faster: If a doctor is going to make $30,000 on fixing a knee, regardless of whether it takes two appointments or 20 appointments, they might as well do a more thorough job upon check-up instead of elongating the process. The flipside of this, of course, is that doctors might optimize for outcome volume and speed rather than the quality of the result itself.<\/p>\n<p>While SpineZone\u2019s early traction is promising, the healthcare ecosystem still has a ways to go before value-based models take precedence. Right now, Kian\u00a0Raiszadeh estimates that 10 to 20% of revenue in a medical center comes from value-based care. SpineZone is projecting that it will get to 50% of revenue in the near future.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the biggest evolution and tallest lift that we\u2019re expecting,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"CEShiMR8yi\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/21\/8-vcs-agree-behavioral-support-and-remote-visits-make-digital-health-a-strong-bet-for-2021\/\">8 VCs agree: Behavioral support and remote visits make digital health a strong bet for 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;8 VCs agree: Behavioral support and remote visits make digital health a strong bet for 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/21\/8-vcs-agree-behavioral-support-and-remote-visits-make-digital-health-a-strong-bet-for-2021\/embed\/#?secret=CEShiMR8yi\" data-secret=\"CEShiMR8yi\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/26\/techcrunch-early-stage-is-the-startup-bootcamp-youve-always-needed\/?tpcc=ECTW2020\">Early Stage<\/a> is the premiere \u2018how-to\u2019 event for startup entrepreneurs and investors.

exploiting four previously undisclosed security flaws in Exchange Server, an enterprise email product built by the software giant.<\/p>\n<p>The technology company said Tuesday that it believes the hacking group, which it calls Hafnium, tries to steal information from a broad range of U.S.-based organizations, including law firms and defense contractors, but also infectious disease researchers and policy think tanks.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft said Hafnium used the four newly discovered security vulnerabilities to break into Exchange email servers running on company networks, granting the attackers to steal data from a victim&#8217;s organization \u2014 such as email accounts and address books \u2014 and the ability to plant malware. When used together, the four vulnerabilities create an attack chain that can compromise vulnerable on-premise servers running Exchange 2013 and later.<\/p>\n<p>Hafnium operates out of China, but uses servers located in the U.S. to launch its attacks, the company said. Microsoft said that Hafnium was the primary threat group it detected using these four new vulnerabilities. <em>(An earlier version of Microsoft&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.microsoft.com\/on-the-issues\/2021\/03\/02\/new-nation-state-cyberattacks\/\">blog post<\/a> incorrectly said Hafnium was the &#8220;only&#8221; group to exploit the vulnerabilities.)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Microsoft declined to say how many successful attacks it had seen, but described the number as &#8220;limited.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Patches to fix those four security vulnerabilities are now out, a week earlier than the company&#8217;s typical patching schedule, usually reserved for the second Tuesday in each month.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Even though we\u2019ve worked quickly to deploy an update for the Hafnium exploits, we know that many nation-state actors and criminal groups will move quickly to take advantage of any unpatched systems,&#8221; said Tom Burt, Microsoft\u2019s vice president for customer security.<\/p>\n<p>The company said it has also briefed U.S. government agencies on its findings, but that the Hafnium attacks are not related to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/17\/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies\/\">the SolarWinds-related espionage campaign<\/a> against U.S. federal agencies.

Founders from around the world arrive in Silicon Valley with visions of record-setting A rounds and billion-dollar valuations. But what if you don\u2019t have unicorn dreams \u2014 or you don\u2019t want to pursue VC money?<\/p>\n<p>Bootstrapping a SaaS company is not only possible \u2014 I believe it\u2019s a saner, more sustainable way to build and scale a business. To be clear, bootstrapping isn\u2019t always easy. It requires patience and focus, but the freedom to create a meaningful product, on your terms, is worth more than even the biggest VC check.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tThe freedom to create a meaningful product, on your terms, is worth more than even the biggest VC check.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">I started my company,<\/span><a style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.jotform.com\/\"> JotForm<\/a><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">, in 2006. We\u2019ve grown steadily from a simple web tool into a product that serves more than 8 million users \u2014 without taking a dime in outside funding. We\u2019re profitable in an industry with big-name competitors like Google.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Most importantly, I still love this company and its mission, and I want the same for my fellow entrepreneurs. If you\u2019re a SaaS founder who\u2019s wary of VC funding, here are my best bootstrapping tips.<\/p>\n<h2>Keep your day job<\/h2>\n<p>Success stories from founders who leap blindly into business without resources or relevant experience are compelling, but they\u2019re the exception, not the rule. Working inside another organization can build your skills, your network and even inspire great product ideas.<\/p>\n<p>After finishing college with a computer science degree, I worked as a developer for a New York media company. The editors always needed custom web forms, which were tedious and time consuming to build. I kept thinking, \u201cThere has to be a better way.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That daily frustration led me to start JotForm \u2014 but I didn\u2019t leave my job right away. I stayed with the media firm for five years and worked on my product on the side. By the time I was ready to go all in, I had the confidence, experience and savings I needed.<\/p>\n<p>Many of the world\u2019s biggest companies began as side projects, including Twitter, Craigslist, Slack, Instagram, Trello, and a little venture called Apple. If your day job doesn\u2019t pay enough to fund the early stages of your business, consider a side gig or consulting work. There are so many ways to set yourself up for success without the pressure of VC cash or selling a chunk of your business.<\/p>\n<h2>Know you\u2019re not alone<\/h2>\n<p>The exact numbers shift every year, but data compiled by<a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/230011\"> Fundable<\/a> show that only 0.05% of U.S. startups are backed by VCs. Another 0.91% are funded by angel investors. The vast majority, at 57%, are funded by credit and personal loans, while 38% get funding from friends and family.<\/p>\n<p>It may feel like most founders raise multimillion-dollar rounds, but that\u2019s simply not the case. It\u2019s also good to remember that securing VC money is complicated and time consuming. You can spend months taking meetings and presenting the perfect deck \u2014 and still leave empty handed. Be patient and stick to your own path.<\/p>\n<h2>Measure profits, not popularity<\/h2>\n<p>SaaS founders often emphasize vanity metrics, like user acquisitions and total downloads. These numbers can measure short-term popularity, but they don\u2019t reveal how users and customers feel about your product \u2014 or your long-term potential.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bootstrapping a SaaS company is not only possible \u2014 I believe it\u2019s a saner, more sustainable way to build and scale a business.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574430,"featured_media":2119912,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"06e2ff06-c045-33cb-8515-a7dd8ab5c0a3"},"categories":[25515,576605952,20429,35394854],"tags":[70302,576846312,576846278,183,29172,449557042],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796353],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/GettyImages-1237975669.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/383KAEP","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.46,"featured":true,"subtitle":"Bootstrapping is a more sustainable way to build and scale","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[2119900],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2119809"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2119809"}],"version-history":[{"count":8,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2119809\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2120114,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2119809\/revisions\/2120114"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/aytekin-tank"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2119809&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574430"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2119912"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2119809"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2119809"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2119809"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2119809"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2119809"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2119809"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2119809"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":2119900,"name":"Aytekin Tank","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/aytekin-tank\/","description":"Aytekin Tank is the founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jotform.com\/\">JotForm<\/a>, an online form builder.

Zipline raises $30M as it helps retailers adapt to the pandemic"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">When I first wrote about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.retailzipline.com\">Retail Zipline<\/a> in 2019, the startup was focused on building a communication platform that would <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/16\/retail-zipline-series-a\/\">help corporate decision-makers in retail communicate with individual stores<\/a>. As you\u2019d probably guess, the startup saw some changes in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen COVID first hit, you might think a company that\u2019s primarily focused on retail would be in trouble,\u201d said co-founder and CTO Jeremy Baker. \u201cBut it turns out that a product that helps retailers communicate critical information when everything is changing is no longer a nice to have.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In other words, where Retail Zipline might previously have been used for coordinating sales and promotions, it suddenly became a channel for managing things like health and safety protocols and communicating about furloughs and closures.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Co-founder and CEO Melissa Wong said the platform supports both engagement (a company executives sending a message to retail associates) and execution (translating a broader corporate strategy into an in-store experience). While you might think that execution was the only thing that mattered in the middle of a pandemic, Wong argued that the engagement side was also essential, particularly when employees felt they were putting themselves at risk.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe engagement part means that we can explain to a retail employee what we\u2019re doing to protect you during this crisis, and your role as part of this company and this brand,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1828959\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1828959\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-1828959\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Tablet-and-Phone-Landscape-2.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Retail Zipline screenshot\" width=\"680\" height=\"491\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Tablet-and-Phone-Landscape-2.jpg 2886w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Tablet-and-Phone-Landscape-2.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Tablet-and-Phone-Landscape-2.jpg?resize=300,216 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Tablet-and-Phone-Landscape-2.jpg?resize=768,554 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Tablet-and-Phone-Landscape-2.jpg?resize=680,491 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Tablet-and-Phone-Landscape-2.jpg?resize=1536,1108 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Tablet-and-Phone-Landscape-2.jpg?resize=2048,1477 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Tablet-and-Phone-Landscape-2.jpg?resize=50,36 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1828959\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Retail Zipline<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>She added that the company has doubled its customer baes during the pandemic and seen revenue increase 2.5x. Retailers using the platform include Sephora, AEO, L.L.Bean, Gap, Hy-Vee, Lush Cosmetics, BevMo, LL Flooring, Cole Haan, The LEGO Group, TOMS and Torrid.<\/p>\n<p>The pandemic also spurred dramatic growth in e-commerce, but Wong (who previously worked on the corporate side of Gap and Old Navy) suggested that this won\u2019t eliminate the need for physical stores. Instead, it just means they\u2019ll have to live up to the long-standing \u201comni-channel promise,&#8221; where they serve as both a store and a distribution center for online orders.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRetail will become more complex,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will enable them to meet those complexities.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Today, Retail Zipline is announcing that it has raised $30 million in Series B funding. The round was led by real estate-focused firm Fifth Wall, with partner Dan Wenhold joining the board of directors. Emergence Capital, Ridge Ventures, Hillsven Capital, Veeva co-founder Matt Wallach and the Fisher Family Fund also participated.<\/p>\n<p>The company has now raised more than $39 million, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/retail-zipline\">according to Crunchbase<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In a blog post, Fifth Wall wrote:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The Fifth Wall network is rich with opportunities for Zipline to explore potential partnerships among our retail-focused partners and portfolio companies. However, we believe retail to be just the beginning for Zipline as we envision the product appealing to many Built World industries. The opportunity for Zipline within real estate could lie with organizations whose HQ office must communicate daily with field operations workers, such as more traditional brokers with a geographic focus (e.g., CBRE, Cushman &amp; Wakefield), leasing agents within multifamily and SFR (e.g., Equity Residential, Greystar), or construction site workers.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"5nFcXAdKXb\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/16\/retail-zipline-series-a\/\">Retail Zipline raises $9.6M from Emergence and Serena Williams<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Retail Zipline raises $9.6M from Emergence and Serena Williams&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/05\/16\/retail-zipline-series-a\/embed\/#?secret=5nFcXAdKXb\" data-secret=\"5nFcXAdKXb\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/26\/techcrunch-early-stage-is-the-startup-bootcamp-youve-always-needed\/?tpcc=ECTW2020\">Early Stage<\/a> is the premiere \u2018how-to\u2019 event for startup entrepreneurs and investors.

the past as desktop has, but Amazon sees a market there to extend Twitch&#8217;s dominance. After launching on Android back in November, the company&#8217;s mobile streaming centric app has <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/id1457912496\">just launched<\/a> on Apple&#8217;s App Store.<\/p>\n<p>The app lets users record short clips (anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes of content) of gameplay from a variety of titles that support screen recording capture. Users can screen record these clips directly into the GameOn library at which point they can add commentary or additional edits before publishing to the GameOn platform or sharing links to the platform on other sites.<\/p>\n<p>The GameOn platform is interestingly fully disconnected from Twitch with separate branding and different channels. Amazon has been partnering with streamers to wholly focus on mobile gaming while promoting challenges unique to the app.The company says the service is compatible with over 1,000 mobile games.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Developers have been increasingly vigilant about brining more full-featured ports of desktop titles to mobile though the lack of sophisticated controls has made this a challenge. As gaming platforms aim to bring cloud streaming networks to iOS there could end up being more demand for shot-on-mobile content and titles that users control with a gamepad, but this will depend on whether the App Store grows more amenable to these platforms over time.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/26\/techcrunch-early-stage-is-the-startup-bootcamp-youve-always-needed\/?tpcc=ECTW2020\">Early Stage<\/a> is the premier \u2018how-to\u2019 event for startup entrepreneurs and investors.

Johnson remained in finance, but Sparhawk later moved on to work at Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>Johnson explains that her experience led her to better understand the economic inequality of women in the U.S., where they only own 32 cents to every dollar in financial assets than men own. A large driver of this is that women leave the workforce, often to raise children, which results in years where they don&#8217;t have earnings.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re really good as a society at supporting women on the way of out of the workforce to care for their kids, but really terrible at supporting them on the way back in,&#8221; Johnson says. &#8220;Women know this, and as an alternative to employment that just seems to fail them, they&#8217;re starting businesses in droves.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2119836\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2119836\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2119836\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/West-Tenth-4.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/West-Tenth-4.png 3600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/West-Tenth-4.png?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/West-Tenth-4.png?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/West-Tenth-4.png?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/West-Tenth-4.png?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/West-Tenth-4.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/West-Tenth-4.png?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/West-Tenth-4.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2119836\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> West Tenth<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https:\/\/www.westtenth.com\/\">West Tenth<\/a>, the goal is to encourage this sort of entrepreneurship &#8212; and more broadly, to help women understand that the many of the talents they&#8217;ve developed at home are, in fact, potential businesses.<\/p>\n<p>This includes opportunities like home-based bakers and cooks, photographers, home organizers or designers, home florists, baby sleep consultants, party planning and event services, crafting classes, fitness training, homemade goods, and more.<\/p>\n<p>The company notes that the app isn&#8217;t necessarily closed to men, but the current market for U.S. home businesses favors women as they&#8217;re more often the partner who chooses to leave work to raise children. However, there are some men on its platform.<\/p>\n<p>Though today many of these entrepreneurs market their home businesses on Facebook, they&#8217;re missing opportunities to reach customers if they&#8217;re not heavily involved in local groups and responding to requests for recommendations. West Tenth instead centralizes local businesses in one place to make discovery easier.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2119843\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2119843\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2119843\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/West-Tenth-9.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/West-Tenth-9.png 3600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/West-Tenth-9.png?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/West-Tenth-9.png?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/West-Tenth-9.png?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/West-Tenth-9.png?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/West-Tenth-9.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/West-Tenth-9.png?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/West-Tenth-9.png?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2119843\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> West Tenth<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In the app, customers can browse and shop local businesses, filtering by category via buttons at the top of the screen.

Through integrated messaging, users can reach out directly for a quote or more information. Customers can also complete their purchases through the app&#8217;s Stripe payments integration. West Tenth takes a 9.5% commission on these sales.<\/p>\n<p>Another key aspect to West Tenth is its education component, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.westtenth.com\/foundry\">The Foundry<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Through a $100 per quarter subscription membership (or $350 per year), business owners will be able to attend bi-monthly events, including classes focused on the fundamentals of setting up home-based businesses, marketing, customer acquisition, and other topics.
