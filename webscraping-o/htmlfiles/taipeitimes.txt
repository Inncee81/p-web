           Responding to concerns about the premier’s age, the CDC deputy director-general said many countries are giving the AstraZeneca vaccine to those aged 65 or older
          </h2>
          <p class="bsp">
           Premier Su Tseng-chang (蘇貞昌) and Minister of Health and Welfare Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) are to be the first people in Taiwan to receive the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, at National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei today, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said yesterday.
As today is the first day of COVID-19 vaccination for frontline healthcare workers most likely to have direct exposure to COVID-19 patients, Su yesterday said he had asked the CECC specialist advisory panel for an assessment and that he would get a shot of the AstraZeneca vaccine today.
The panel last week suggested that Su and Chen take the lead in the nation’s inoculation drive to reassure the public that the vaccine is safe, as concerns were raised after a few countries partially suspended AstraZeneca vaccinations due to some reported cases of blood clots.
At the CECC’s news conference, Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang (莊人祥), who is the CECC’s spokesman, confirmed that Su and Chen would arrive at the hospital at 7:40am to be vaccinated.
Asked whether Su, who is over 65, should receive the vaccine, Chuang said the AstraZeneca vaccine is not being given to people aged 65 or older in some countries, because there were fewer older participants in the vaccine’s clinical trials.
However, the AstraZeneca vaccine is being offered to people aged 65 or older in the UK and some European countries, as well as South Korea, which initially had not approved the vaccine for the age group, he said. 
So far there have been no abnormal effects reported after vaccination in this age group, he added.
The CECC on Friday held an online meeting with local health departments and 57 hospitals that would be offering the vaccine to explain the vaccination procedure, Chuang said.
An Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting was also held on Friday,

           Thousands protest Europe virus curbs as surges prompt fresh restrictions

           Thousands of protesters angry at COVID-19 restrictions on Saturday rallied in cities across Europe as several nations reimposed partial lockdowns to fight new surges in infections.
The virus, which has killed more than 2.7 million people, has been spreading faster recently, with the number of new infections up globally by 14 percent in the past week, Agence France-Presse data showed.
That has forced governments to impose social distancing and movement restrictions again, even as vaccines are rolled out, with residents in Poland, parts of France and Ukraine’s capital the latest to face fresh curbs.
However, populations have grown increasingly weary of the economically painful restrictions, and frustrations spilled over in cities across Europe with thousands marching in Germany, Switzerland and the UK.
Demonstrators in the German city of Kassel held up signs including “End the lockdown” and “Corona rebels,” as they participated in a protest organized by activists from the far-left and the far-right, as well as peddlers of baseless conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccines.
Authorities used water cannons, batons and pepper spray to disperse the Kassel protesters.
A Kassel police spokesman said they numbered between 15,000 and 20,000 — one of the largest such rallies so far this year.
Thousands also demonstrated in London against virus curbs, including many carrying signs promoting COVID-19 conspiracy theories. 
The Metropolitan Police said that 36 people were arrested, most for breaking the restrictions, with a spokesperson adding that a group of about 100 demonstrators threw missiles at officers.
There were also anti-restriction protests in Amsterdam, Vienna, the Bulgarian capital of Sofia and the Swiss town of Liestal.
Meanwhile, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan became the latest world leader to test positive — two days after receiving China’s Sinopharm vaccine. The former cricketing legend is self-isolating with mild symptoms, his spokesman said.
Hopes of ending the pandemic have been boosted with

            POLL RESULTS:
           </font>
           While innovation and digital skills were viewed as important, 93.4% of respondents thought that the promotion of lifelong learning was also necessary                                In a survey released yesterday, 96.4 percent of respondents said it is important for future talent in the nation to be bilingual.
The survey by the Professor Huang Kun-huei Education Foundation showed that 97.8 percent of respondents said it was important for future talent to possess the ability to innovate, 95.7 percent said it was important for future talent to have digital skills and 97.7 percent said it was important for future talent to demonstrate civic literacy.
At a news conference in Taipei held to release the survey results, Lu Mu-lin (呂木琳), a professor at Ming Chuan University’s Graduate School of Education, said there is a high degree of public consensus on the need for future talent to be bilingual and innovative, and possess digital abilities and civic literacy.
The inclusion of those skills and qualities in the 12-Year Basic Education Curriculum Guidelines shows that the Ministry of Education is aware of their importance, said Lu, who was deputy minister of education from 2006 to 2009.
He said it would be challenging to convert those goals into results and urged the ministry to contemplate how to design courses that would achieve them.
The Executive Yuan on Dec. 6, 2018, passed a “blueprint for developing a bilingual nation” submitted by the National Development Council, with the aim of achieving widespread English fluency by 2030.
The survey also showed that 80.6 percent of people agreed that the government should take measures to encourage exceptional international students in Taiwan to stay and work after graduating.
Of the respondents, 85.5 percent agreed that the ministry should relax regulations to give universities more flexibility to accept requests from the corporate sector to host the talent training courses, the foundation said.
Of those interviewed, 90.3 percent agreed that to protect the nation’s information security, the government should allocate more resources and funding to training

           The Philippines’ defense minister called on China on Sunday to recall about 220 Chinese fishing vessels it believes are crewed by militias spotted in the disputed South China Sea, saying the presence of the vessels is “a clear provocative action of militarizing the area.”
“We call on the Chinese to stop this incursion and immediately recall these boats violating our maritime rights and encroaching into our sovereign territory,” Philippine Secretary of National Defense Delfin Lorenzana said in a statement.
A Philippine government body overseeing the disputed region late on Saturday said that the Chinese vessels were seen moored at Whitsun Reef on March 7. 
It released photographs of the vessels lying side-by-side in one of the most hotly contested areas of the strategic waterway.
The reef, which Manila calls Julian Felipe, is a boomerang-shaped and shallow coral region about 175 nautical miles (324km) west of Bataraza town in the western Philippine province of Palawan. 
It is well within the country’s exclusive economic zone, over which the Philippines “enjoys the exclusive right to exploit or conserve any resources,” the agency said in a statement.
The large number of Chinese boats are “a concern due to the possible overfishing and destruction of the marine environment, as well as risks to safety of navigation,” it said.
However, it added that the vessels were not fishing when sighted. 
Asked if the Philippines would file a protest, Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Teodoro Locsin Jr wrote on Twitter: “Only if the generals tell me.”
Taiwan, Brunei, China, Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam have been locked in a tense territorial standoff over the resource-rich and busy waterway for decades.

           Philippine troops killed an Abu Sayyaf rebel commander blamed for years of ransom kidnappings and yesterday rescued the last of his four Indonesian captives, the military said.
Marines wounded Amajan Sahidjuan in a gunbattle on Saturday night and he later died from a loss of blood on Kalupag Island in the southernmost province of Tawi-Tawi. Two other militants managed to flee and dragged along the last of four Indonesian hostages, but troops finally rescued him yesterday, regional military commander Lieutenant General Corleto Vinluan Jr said. 
On Thursday night, three Indonesian men were rescued by police who also captured one of their Abu Sayyaf captors along shore of South Ubian town in Tawi-Tawi.
The military said the Abu Sayyaf militants led by Sahidjuan were fleeing assaults in nearby Sulu province when their speedboat was lashed by huge waves and overturned off Tawi-Tawi. 
A military officer said the militants were attempting to cross the sea border to Tambisan Island in neighboring Malaysia’s Sabah state to release the captives in exchange for a ransom of at least 5 million pesos (US$103,457), but the military got wind of the plan and launched covert assaults.
The officer, who has a keen knowledge of anti-Abu Sayyaf operations, spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to speak publicly.
Vinluan said that the rescue of the Indonesian men, the last known hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf, would enable government forces to finish off the ransom-seeking rebels. 
“It will just be relentless in a massive and focused military operation, because now we would not worry about kidnap victims getting hit,” Vinluan said by telephone. 
Vinluan said there were about 80 Abu Sayyaf gunmen left in Sulu and outlying island provinces. 
One of their remaining leaders, Radulan Sahiron, has fallen ill and was wounded in a recent offensive in

           Despite distrusting the jabs, a majority of Taiwanese would support ‘meaningful dialogue’ across the Taiwan Strait, a survey found                                Sixty-seven percent of Taiwanese would refuse a COVID-19 vaccine produced by a Chinese manufacturer, while 24.3 percent would accept it, a survey showed yesterday.
The poll, designed by the Taiwan International Strategic Study Society and the Taiwan International Studies Association, asked people about Taiwan-China relations and Taiwan-US relations under the administration of US President Joe Biden. 
The results of the survey, conducted by Focus Survey Research, were announced at a news conference at the Howard Plaza Hotel in Taipei.
It showed that only 5.4 percent of respondents “very much approved” if Taiwan were to import vaccines from China, while 18.9 percent “approved.”
Of the 67 percent who did not approve, 27.1 percent said they “mostly disapproved,” while 39.9 percent said they “very much disapproved,” it showed.
Asked whether they hoped Taiwan and China could resume meaningful dialogue, 77.9 percent said they did, while 13.7 percent said they did not, the survey showed.
“There is a contradiction in the results. The majority does not want Chinese vaccines, but a majority wants dialogue with China,” said Wang Kun-yi (王崑義), an associate professor at Tamkang University, who heads the Strategic Study Society. 
This might be because China did not provide scientific data on its vaccines, he added.
Asked about their opinion on US’ assistance to Taiwan’s defense, only 21.3 percent said they felt that the US was sincere, while 61.1 percent said they felt that the US’ intention was to exploit Taiwan, the survey showed. 
“Taiwan plays an important role in the framework of US-China competition. However, despite its efforts over the past two to three years, the US has not won the trust of Taiwanese,” society executive director Lo Ching-sheng (羅慶生) said, adding that Washington would need to work harder to improve its relationship with Taiwan. 
Asked whether they believe that Biden could “rely on his political experience

           The annual report highlighted Taiwan’s outstanding performance in containing the COVID-19 pandemic, but listed it as ‘Taiwan province of China’                                Taiwan was ranked as the world’s 24th-happiest nation and the happiest in East Asia, in a report released on Friday that compared the happiness level in 149 countries and territories.
It was the highest Taiwan has ever ranked in the World Happiness Report, released by the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network since 2012, annually on the day before the International Day of Happiness, which was yesterday.
Taiwan scored 6,584 points, up from 6,455 in last year’s edition.
Last year “has been a year like no other. This whole report focuses on the effects of COVID-19 and how people all over the world have fared,” the report said. “Our aim was two-fold, first to focus on the effects of COVID-19 on the structure and quality of people’s lives, and second to describe and evaluate how governments all over the world have dealt with the pandemic.”
Compared with its neighbors, China, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan, Taiwan recorded the fewest COVID-19 cases, as it drew from experience with the 2003 SARS outbreak, and conducted thorough virus tracing and imposed quarantines on arrivals from abroad, it said.
Taiwan successfully allocated personal protective equipment, and the government transparently provided information on the disease, the report said, adding that the Taiwanese public had shown high awareness on self-protection.
The happiest country in the world was Finland (7,842 points), followed by Denmark (7,620), Switzerland (7,571), Iceland (7,554), the Netherlands (7,464), Norway (7,392), Sweden (7,363), Luxembourg (7,324), New Zealand (7,277) and Austria (7,268), it showed.
It was the fourth consecutive year Finland has taken the top spot.
China ranked 84th, down from 52nd last year.
However, as Taiwan is not a member of the UN, the report showed it as “Taiwan province of China,” prompting a protest by the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York, which called on the UN to respect Taiwan’s

           Taiwan has never been a part of the People’s Republic of China, the MAC said, urging Beijing to face the realities of cross-strait relations                                            The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) yesterday hit back at China’s repeated assertion of sovereignty over Taiwan during talks with the US in Alaska, saying that the Republic of China is a sovereign nation whose future could only be decided by its 23 million people.
Chinese officials were reportedly “defensive” after the US raised concerns over Beijing’s coercion of Taiwan during high-level talks in Anchorage on Thursday and Friday, their first since US President Joe Biden took office in January.
The two sides on Thursday traded barbs during unusually long opening remarks to reporters, followed by “tough and direct” dialogue during which the US also accused Beijing of human rights abuses in Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet.
Taiwan has never been a part of the People’s Republic of China, the council said, urging Beijing to face up to cross-strait realities, including popular opposition among Taiwanese to China’s political framework.
It also called on China to halt its military and diplomatic pressure against Taiwan and remove its preconditions for dialogue so that the two sides could pragmatically resolve their political differences.
Meanwhile, Premier Su Tseng-chang (蘇貞昌) was upbeat about the new US administration’s vocal concern over Chinese persecution of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Xinjiang.
Taiwan, the US and many other nations all share the values of freedom and democracy, but some authoritarian extremists have an outsized effect on the world order, Su said in response to media queries during a visit to the Hygge Healthcare long-term care center in Taoyuan.
While many are worried about totalitarianism, a growing number of people worldwide are also united in the hope that together they can maintain peace and stability, as well as enable the continued viability of freedom and democracy, Su said.
The Anchorage talks marked a change from past practice in that both sides directly addressed their conflicting views, he added.

           Taiwan and China could launch discussions on integration, rather than unification, to establish an integration program similar to ASEAN, Annette Lu said                                            Former vice president Annette Lu (呂秀蓮) yesterday suggested breaking the impasse between Taiwan and China by using the phrase “one Chinese” (一個中華), instead of “one China” (一個中國) and “integration” instead of the “unification” of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. 
Ahead of the launch of her new book on how to settle old scores between the two sides of the Strait, Lu introduced a third way beyond unification and independence to deal with cross-strait relations. 
She suggested that Beijing change its “one China” principle into a broader “one Chinese” principle, which she said would be more acceptable to Taiwan.
Lu also proposed launching discussions on “integration” instead of “unification of the two sides of the Strait,” similar to regional integration programs such as ASEAN, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the EU. 
Taiwan should form a “golden triangle” in Northeast Asia by aligning with Japan and South Korea, while inviting Canada and the US to establish a democratic Pacific commonwealth, she said.
In addition to developing relations with China, Taiwan should also work to develop relations with nations around the Pacific Ocean, Lu said. 
She expressed hope that her new book would not only provide Taiwan with new perspectives on cross-strait relations, but also give China a chance to reconsider new cross-strait ties. 
While Taiwan is considered safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is under constant threat of war from China, Lu said, adding that Taiwan should therefore use its soft power for diplomatic purposes.

           The Ministry of National Defense has elaborated on the military’s countermeasures against China’s “gray-zone conflict” tactics in a comprehensive review of Taiwan’s defense strategy.
The ministry’s 2021 Quadrennial Defense Review, which was on Thursday delivered to the Legislative Yuan’s Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee for review, highlights the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) increasing use of gray-zone conflict methods, including cognitive warfare, disinformation, and air and sea patrols.
The methods are employed by the PLA to exhaust Taiwan’s armed forces and morale, the ministry said.
The PLA’s cognitive warfare strategy is based on the “three forms of warfare” concept, which refers to public opinion warfare, psychological warfare and legal warfare, which are conducted to create internal contradictions in Taiwan, the ministry said.
The ministry’s answer to cognitive warfare is the creation of rapid response mechanisms that use technology to counter disinformation, provide factual rebuttals across multiple media, stop public panic, and create counter-narratives with international partners, it said.
China has reorganized its forces to augment its cyberwarfare capabilities, and PLA cyberunits are deployed for intelligence gathering and for stealing military, industrial and commercial secrets, it said.
Another part of the PLA’s effort is directed toward identifying gaps in Taiwan’s cyberinfrastructure to exploit them, including attacking these targets during a war to paralyze the nation’s government, security forces and military, the ministry said.
The armed forces are to stop these threats by implementing information security mechanisms, increasing defensive capabilities and strengthening collaboration with cybersecurity agencies, it said.
The integration of military and civilian cybersecurity systems and the training of cybersecurity experts must be emphasized, the ministry added.
The PLA’s use of air and sea patrols to harass Taiwan is countered by the rapid deployment of reaction forces, the ministry said. 
The military has made and will continue to make rolling adjustments to incident management protocols and the general combat

           Hundreds of people from Taiwan’s Burmese community yesterday rallied in central Taipei to denounce the coup in Myanmar, singing defiant songs and holding white and red roses in mourning for those who have died protesting the military.
Taiwan is home to about 40,000 people originally from Myanmar, most of whom are ethnic Chinese. Some are descendants of Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) troops trapped in Myanmar, then called Burma, at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. Others have come more recently, fleeing repression and anti-Chinese sentiment.
Dressed in white, the color of mourning, holding pictures of detained Burmese State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi and signs condemning the coup, about 400 people protested at Liberty Square, mainly Sino-Burmese, but also non-Chinese Burmese citizens, Taiwanese and Hong Kongers.
“People in Myanmar are once again forced to live under the dark shadow of the military regime. As an emigrant from Myanmar, today we gather here to pay tribute to our fellow countrymen and those fallen heroes,” Yangon-born Thomas Chen, 28, a teacher of Burmese at Taipei’s Soochow University, told the crowd.
People sang We Won’t Be Satisfied Until the End of the World, the Burmese-language anthem from the country’s 1988 pro-democracy uprising, brutally put down by the military government of the time, and bowed their heads in prayer to remember the dead.
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Hung Sun-han (洪申翰) accused China of supporting the coup. 
Beijing denies this, although many people in Myanmar view China as supporting the junta that seized power on Feb. 1.
“We know that behind this military coup there are forces from [the] Chinese Communist [Party]. This is the thing that people can’t stand the most,” Hung said.
Sunday last week saw arson attacks against 32 Chinese-invested companies in the Yangon suburb of Hlaingthaya, although demonstrators played down fears of wider anti-Chinese

           Taiwan has upgraded 42 of its 141 F-16A/B jets to the F-16V variant, which can “detect enemies earlier and have a longer striking range,” air force Chief of Staff Huang Chih-wei (黃志偉) said on Wednesday. 
The upgraded jets would be given to the Fourth Tactical Fighter Wing, making it the first air force unit in the nation to be entirely comprised of the more advanced jets, Huang told a legislative session in Taipei when questioned by lawmakers about progress in the F-16 upgrade project. 
A formal handover ceremony would be held at the end of this month, with President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) as a special guest, Huang said. 
In 2016, the air force launched a program to upgrade all its F-16A/Bs to F-16Vs, which are equipped with more advanced avionics, including the APG-83 Scalable Agile Beam Radar, helmet-mounted cueing system, and other flight management and electronic warfare systems.
State-run Aerospace Industrial Development Corp and the US-based defense firm Lockheed Martin, which manufactures the jets, were commissioned to complete the program before 2023, at an estimated cost of NT$110 billion (US$3.86 billion). 
Huang told legislators that the F-16V has all of Taiwan’s airspace within its striking range. 
In addition to the retrofitted jets, Taiwan has purchased 66 new F-16Vs from the US, with delivery expected to start in 2023. 
Asked about the air force’s planned operational expenses in the face of increased harassment by the Chinese military, Huang said an additional NT$2.1 billion has been allocated for this year, which “should be enough.” 
Last year, the air force spent NT$30 billion to intercept Chinese military planes that entered Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, according to data provided by legislators. 
Huang told lawmakers that it costs about NT$150,000 per hour to deploy an F-16 in such situations, NT$220,000 for an Indigenous Defense Fighter

           Lee Women’s Hospital superintendent Lee Mao-sheng said a diminished ovarian reserve might be due to stress or environmental pollutants                                            A survey of nearly 4,000 women who sought infertility treatment at Lee Women’s Hospital in Taichung last year shows that more than 5 percent of those aged 30 or younger had a low egg cell count.
Nearly 10 percent of those aged 35 or younger and more than 14 percent of those aged 38 or younger had an anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level below 1.2, hospital superintendent Lee Mao-sheng (李茂盛) said.
The survey indicates lower fertility in Taiwanese women, said Lee, an obstetrician and gynecologist, adding that trying to conceive or freezing one’s eggs earlier could be a solution.
The American Society for Reproductive Medicine and the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology defines an AMH level of less than 1.2 as a diminished ovarian reserve, Lee said.
Women with an AMH level of less than 1.2 can become pregnant, but lower levels indicate decreased egg quality and quantity, which could affect fertility, he said.
Women aged 35 or younger typically have an AMH level of 2 to 5, and the level decreases with age, said hospital CEO Lee Chun-i (李俊逸), also an obstetrician and gynecologist.
The increased prevalence of diminished ovarian reserve in local women could be attributed to stress or exposure to an endocrine disruptor, such as a type of environmental pollution or food that causes an increased number of free radicals and faster aging, Lee Mao-sheng said.
While women with an AMH level of less than 1.2 would not experience symptoms, they might have premature ovarian failure, he added.
A woman in her 20s sought infertility treatment and while she had an AMH level of 1.0 and her husband had poor semen quality, in vitro fertilization enabled them to have a son last year, Lee Mao-sheng said.
Women who want to conceive should take an AMH test, he said, adding that those shown to have a

           Vice President William Lai said that people should not look at appearances and choose to misunderstand, but rather choose to give more support                                            As more than 20,000 people with Down syndrome live in Taiwan, Vice President William Lai (賴清德) yesterday urged the public to give them more support and encouragement.
Lai issued the call during a visit to the “We’ll Be There” (嘿!小唐我在這) exhibition at the Red House Theater (西門紅樓) in Taipei’s Ximending (西門町) area.
Yesterday marked World Down Syndrome Day, its 10th celebration since the UN set aside March 21 to raise public awareness of Down syndrome and to advocate for the rights, inclusion and well-being of people with the syndrome, Lai said.
“Down syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality caused by an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21; it is not a terrifying disease,” said Lai, a former physician.
Although the incidence of Down syndrome varies by country, one in every 1,000 to 1,200 live births has it, so there are about 20,000 to 30,000 people with it in Taiwan, Lai said.
That is not very many, but neither is it rare, he added.
The exhibition, held by the Down Syndrome Foundation, is called: “We’ll Be There,” because the foundation hopes that Taiwanese would understand and accept people with Down syndrome, he said, adding that the public should know that people with Down syndrome live in their communities and help them live normally with others.
Lai said that as a doctor, he met many children with Down syndrome, and found them to be sociable and loving — if people show them love, they might show even more love back to them.
“People with Down syndrome are the same as anyone, as we all go through different stages in life. They are no different from us, but only a bit extraordinary,” he said.
People should not look at their appearance and misunderstand, but rather choose to give them more support and encouragement, Lai added.
As the exhibition closes on May 9,

           Female scientists are often required to juggle their research and family responsibilities, researchers told an awards ceremony on Saturday, urging institutions to implement better work conditions for women.
Female researchers have been known to quickly return home to children from overseas events and  work on their theses in a postpartum care center, National Taiwan University (NTU) distinguished professor Lin Yi-yi (林依依) said.
Lin, who won Most Outstanding Researcher at the 14th annual Taiwan Outstanding Women in Science awards ceremony, said that improving work conditions for female scientists would allow them to excel at their research, which in turn would benefit the nation.
The awards ceremony — held jointly by L’Oreal and the Wu Chien-shiung Education Foundation — recognizes female scientists for outstanding achievements in their field.
The Young Scientist of Excellence award was won by National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University assistant professor Wu Hsin-chieh (吳欣潔) and NTU assistant professor Chen Yun-nung (陳縕儂).
NTU post-doctoral researcher Chuang Tsao-chi (莊造奇) won a scholarship named for Meng Tsui-chu (孟粹珠), a woman who researched and taught at National Yang-Ming University. 
Lin’s research, which includes satellite telemetry, the Earth’s atmosphere and the oceans, analyzes data from typhoon-hunter aircraft and advanced satellite telemetry to study the interaction between ocean waters and typhoons, as well as the effects of global warming on El Nino and La Nina weather phenomena. 
Her work was recognized for its contributions to forecasting typhoons, the foundation said. 
“Doing research makes me feel like I’m Alice in Wonderland. Every day, there are fascinating discoveries,” she said. 
However, institutions must create better environments for female researchers with children, such as allowing meetings to be conducted online, she added. 
Wu’s research studies green energy development and applications, including thermodynamics and pyroelectric materials. Her work has been subsidized by the Ministry of Science and Technology. 
Wu said that she

           Firms that discriminate against job applicants based on their blood type or astrological sign can be fined, the Taipei City Government said on Saturday.
The reminder came after an applicant complained that he was asked his blood type and astrological sign in an interview, Taipei Department of Labor Commissioner Chen Hsin-yu (陳信瑜) said.
After the applicant told the interviewers, they reportedly said that the firm was looking for “a quiet worker who would not make waves or steal his section supervisor’s thunder,” implying that blood type “O” and a “Leo” sign were not the “right” personality, she said.
The applicant believed that he was not hired because of this, Chen added.
If the firm is found to have contravened Article 5 of the Employment Service Act (就業服務法), it could face a fine of up to NT$1.5 million (US$52,700), Chen said.
Article 5 prohibits discriminating against a job applicant or employee based on race, language, religion, gender, age, astrological sign, blood type, marital status or other personal information.
“Some employers have strong views on blood type, astrological sign and similar information, and would check these when filling a job vacancy, instead of considering a candidate’s skills, job experience and track record,” she said.
In 2018, the Ministry of Labor amended the law, adding blood type and astrological sign to Article 5, to prevent companies from discriminating against jobseekers and denying them an open, fair interview process.
“Firms should ignore applicants’ personality traits and personal circumstances that have no bearing on their ability to perform a job,” Chen said, adding that an investigation is under way.

            The government has pledged to supply sufficient water to high-tech firms, the economics minister said, while chipmakers are buying water trucks                            Taiwan is facing the most severe water shortage in 56 years due to a lack of rainfall, but it is also the best time for reservoir dredging, as lower water levels expose silt and sand, the Water Resources Agency said in a statement on Friday. 
As many reservoirs in Taiwan have over the years accumulated too much sediment and are losing storage capacity, the government has increased dredging efforts, the agency said in a statement.
Last year, dredging at the nation’s reservoirs had removed 14.4 million cubic meters of sediment, the most on record and about 2.6 times the annual average, the agency said.
In the first three months of this year, the government had dredged 3.57 million cubic meters of sediment from reservoirs, an increase of 280,000 cubic meters from the 3.29 million cubic meters in the same period of last year, doubling the annual average of 1.79 million cubic meters over the past 10 years, the agency said.
“We will continue to dispatch more machinery and workers to increase excavation and maximize dredging,” the statement said.
The volume of dredging was in the past relatively small, as the government mainly used excavators and truck transportation for reservoir dredging.
However, the volume of dredging has continued to rise, due to better governance and management, including conservation of upstream reservoir catchment areas, excavation of bottom sediment in the reservoirs and the use of hydraulic systems for sand discharge, it said.
The government last year removed 3.34 million cubic meters of sediment from the Shihmen Reservoir (石門水庫) in Taoyuan and 3.82 million cubic meters from the Zengwen Reservoir (曾文水庫) in Chiayi County, which not only exceeded the annual accumulation of sediment, but also helped enhance the reservoirs’ capacity by 1.2 million cubic meters and 1.55 million cubic meters respectively, the agency said.

            Foreign governments would have to invest US$30 billion per year for five years to catch up with TSMC and its main competitor, Samsung, an analyst said                            To finance production expansions, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電) would issue up to NT$120 billion (US$4.13 billion) in bonds, the company said on Friday.
The world’s largest contract chipmaker is to initially issue a batch of NT$21.1 billion in three unsecured corporate bond tranches: a five-year tranche of NT$4.8 billion with a coupon rate of 0.5 percent, a seven-year tranche of NT$11.4 billion with 0.55 percent and a 10-year tranche of NT$4.9 billion with 0.6 percent, TSMC said.
The plan, approved by a board meeting last month, would increase production capacity through new facilities and equipment upgrades, and pollution prevention measures at its fabs, it said.
Capital Securities Corp (群益證券) would serve as the lead underwriter of the bond sale, TSMC said.
In an investors’ conference held in mid-January, TSMC vice president and chief financial officer Wendell Huang (黃仁昭) said that the company would spend US$25 billion to US$28 billion on capital expenditure this year, a record for the chipmaker.
US-based advisory firm IC Insights said that governments in the US, EU and China would each have to spend at least US$30 billion per year for five years to catch up with TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co.
The combined capital expenditure of TSMC and Samsung is forecast to total at least US$55.5 billion this year, making it unlikely for any other chipmaker to rival them in spending, IC Insights said, adding that the two firms are expected to further widen their technology gaps with their competitors.
However, capacity shortages in the chip industry have over the past few months disrupted production at smartphone makers and automakers.
On Wednesday, Samsung said that its smartphone production in the second quarter could be affected by global chip shortages.

            Line Bank Taiwan Ltd (連線商業銀行), the second Internet-only bank in the nation, is to begin trial operations on Wednesday, before an official launch next month, Line Bank general manager Morris Huang (黃以孟) said on Friday.
The bank has completed several rounds of tests, such as stress tests, integration tests and user tests, and the bank is well-prepared to open to the public, Huang said.
The bank also signed an agreement with Central Deposit Insurance Corp (CDIC, 中央存保) to provide deposit insurance to its clients.
Huang said that 700 employees of the three Taiwanese subsidiaries of Line Corp would be offered services in the trial.
As a Web-only bank, it has placed much emphasis on cybersecurity, Huang said.
The bank would initially offer debit card services and personal loans, but more preparations would be needed before credit card services could be offered, he said.
Once it offers services to the public, the bank would start with a promotion campaign, but it would not initially engage in price competition to achieve a certain market share, Huang said.
Line Financial Taiwan Corp (台灣連線金融科技), which owns 49.9 percent of Line Bank, last quarter started a similar Internet-only bank in Thailand — Line Bk — which has been faring as expected, Huang said.
The Thai bank’s performance would serve as a benchmark for the Taiwanese operations, he said.
Rakuten International Commercial Bank Co (樂天國際商銀), Taiwan’s first Web-only bank, opened in January, while Next Bank (將來銀行) is expected to become the third, as its application to begin operations is under review at the Financial Supervisory Commission.

            The central bank on Thursday further tightened restrictions on mortgage loans to curb housing speculation, as domestic banks’ real-estate financing has continued to increase. It capped the loan-to-value ratio at 40 percent for corporate entities, 55 percent for individuals buying their third home and 50 percent for those buying their fourth home. The goal is to stem a deluge of loans into the real-estate sector and rein in credit risks. 
The central bank also capped the loan-to-value ratio at 55 percent for idle industrial land, and said it would monitor the developments in the nation’s housing market and local banks’ management of credit risks related to real-estate financing.
The new measures took effect on Friday and the central bank said it would make adjustments if necessary.
The move is clearly aimed at property speculators, primarily those who flip presale housing units. The bank said individuals and businesses that own more than four properties are the main targets of its new measures, while market watchers said investment firms that buy and sell properties rapidly are especially targeted. 
About 54.51 percent of non-real-estate corporate entities sold their properties within a year of purchase, data compiled by the Ministry of the Interior show.
The central bank’s latest credit controls came a week after the Executive Yuan approved a draft amendment to the Income Tax Act (所得稅法) to impose heavier taxes on properties sold within certain periods after purchase to rein in speculation in the market. For instance, individuals and businesses would face a 45 percent tax on property transaction gains involving homes or land sold within two years of purchase, and a 35 percent tax on homes or land sold within two to five years of purchase. The bill was on Friday sent to the legislature’s Finance Committee for review.
The government’s measures have so far been

            Comparing the treatment of Taiwan in the 2017 White House National Security Strategy with the 2021 Interim National Security Strategic Guidance provides a subtle but potentially significant insight.
The 2017 strategy document stated, “We will maintain our strong ties with Taiwan in accordance with our ‘One China’ policy, including our commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide for Taiwan’s legitimate defense needs and deter coercion.” The emphasis of this statement is on security, reflecting the Trump administration’s abiding concern about threats to Taiwan.
The Biden administration’s interim strategy document, released this month, stated, “We will support China’s neighbors and commercial partners in defending their rights to make independent political choices free of coercion or undue foreign influence… We will support Taiwan, a leading democracy and critical economic and security partner, in line with longstanding American commitments.”
Although the commitments that the document referenced were not spelled out, they presumably are shorthand for the Taiwan Relations Act and the United States Six Assurances to Taiwan. These assurances, provided by the Reagan administration to then-president Chiang Ching-kuo (蔣經國) in 1982, sought to dispel concerns that Washington would negotiate with Beijing over matters relating to America’s support for Taiwan. The Six Assurances have evolved into policy norms that successive administrations have followed consistently.
There are limits, of course, to lessons that can be drawn from comparing two strategy documents published four years apart. Much has changed over the past four years. US-Taiwan relations have strengthened in key areas just as US-China and cross-Strait relations have deteriorated and Beijing has trampled Hong Kong’s autonomy.
Nevertheless, the 2017 strategy document reveals a security-centric focus on Taiwan, whereas the 2021 document refers to Taiwan as a security, economic, and democratic partner. This broadening of the frame in which Taiwan is viewed in Washington likely reflects an evolution in how Washington

            Israel is in a semi-arid climate zone, with more than 60 percent of its land covered by desert. It is considered one of the most water-stressed countries in the world, experiencing annual extreme variations in precipitation, as well as multiple and consecutive years of drought.
From its early years of statehood, Israel needed to address the challenge of water scarcity, a fact that has undoubtedly shaped the development of the Israeli water sector over the past seven decades.
To survive and strive, Israel had no choice but to adapt and develop a series of innovative water technologies and practices, as well as national water resources and systems reforms.
This approach, encompassing good management, high-tech development and public education, has transformed Israel from a water-parched nation to a global leader in the water sector.
In Israel, the balance between water demand and supply shows a constant deficit, growing from year to year. The permanent challenge is to close the gap.
Furthermore, and most importantly, natural replenishment of water resources is challenged by the effects of climate change: Droughts are more frequent, more intense and occur for longer periods.
Managing the national water sector, while coping with scarcity, poses a complex challenge that requires an optimal response.
Israel’s water sector has undergone significant changes in almost all aspects: physical, structural, legislative and organizational, following the understanding that the only possible way to cope with natural water shortage on one hand, and a growing population and life quality standards on the other, was to adopt and implement an integrated water resources management approach.
To achieve a reliable water supply, Israel has over the years gradually implemented holistic and integrative policies, combining institutional and infrastructure reforms. 
These include a national water system connecting all regional water infrastructures to a national level system and the large-scale reuse of treated wastewater for agriculture. Reclaimed

          DEVASTATING BLOW:

         With James facing an extended layoff, the already short-staffed Lakers have to change their mindset to remain champions, their coach said                            LeBron James on Saturday crashed out of the Los Angeles Lakers’ 99-94 loss to the Atlanta Hawks with a right ankle injury that could sideline the NBA superstar indefinitely.
The Lakers superstar collapsed to the Staples Center court in agony after a collision with Atlanta’s Solomon Hill in the second quarter, crying out in pain and clutching his right ankle.
The 36-year-old returned briefly to hit a three-pointer before limping back to the locker room, knocking over a chair in frustration.
ESPN later reported that a magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a high ankle sprain and that James faced an “indefinite” injury layoff.
Depending on the severity, high ankle sprains can take anywhere from a few weeks up to several months to recover from.
James did not speak to reporters, but later wrote on Twitter that he would return as soon as possible.
“Nothing angers and saddens me more than not being available to and for my teammates!” James wrote. “I’m hurt inside and out right now. The road back from recovery begins now. Back soon like I never left.”
A lengthy layoff for James would be a devastating blow to the reigning champion Lakers, who are already without star Anthony Davis as he recovers from Achilles tendon trouble.
“It’s certainly going to be a challenge any time you’re undermanned,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “But if you play team first basketball and you defend at our level, you’ll have a chance to win and that’ll be our mindset.”
Lakers teammates Kyle Kuzma and Montrezl Harrell said that the sight of James leaving the arena was unnerving.
“We do forget he’s human sometimes, to see him in pain like that,” said Harrell, who was unhappy with Hill’s dive for the ball that led to James’ injury.
“We don’t feel like it was one of those basketball-type plays,” he added. “He had

           Defending champion Viktor Axelsen was yesterday to face Malaysia’s Lee Zii Jia in the final of badminton’s All England Open.
Axelsen on Saturday got the better of an all-Danish semi-final, coming from behind to beat Anders Antonsen 16-21, 21-7, 21-17.
Lee should go into the showdown fresher, as he cruised through an earlier semi-final 21-13, 21-17 over Dutchman Mark Caljouw.
After 21 years without a Danish men’s singles champion, Axelsen broke the duck last year and just had enough to hold off his younger compatriot in a battle between the second and third seeds.
“It was a crazy game. Lot of back and forth, lot of nerves, lot of good rallies — it had everything,” Axelsen said.
The 2016 Olympic bronze medalist kept his cool to edge ahead at the crucial point of a tight decider, before taking his first match point with an unchallenged Antonsen error.
Lee shocked world No. 1 Kento Momota to reach the last four, and the 22-year-old suffered no dip in form as he comfortably saw off the unseeded Caljouw.
“It is my first All England final, so very happy about the performance,” Lee said.
“In the second game I lost focus a bit, but luckily I managed to get back my momentum,” he added.
Japan’s Nozomi Okuhara was yesterday to face Thailand’s Pornpawee Chochuwong of Thailand in the women’s final, after edging a classic clash with Ratchanok Intanon 16-21, 21-16, 21-19.
Second seed Okuhara battled back from losing the first set in an entertaining match.
Intanon raced into a 13-8 lead in the decider, before a series of costly errors allowed Okuhara to turn the set and match around to go ahead 20-18.
The first match point was saved by Intanon, but a wayward forehand drive sealed her fate.
Chochuwong powered into the final with a comprehensive 21-17, 21-9 win over Indian fifth seed Pusarla Venkata Sindhu.

Organizers said they hope it will help set a high standard for clubs                                        Formosa yesterday defeated PCCT, as the PCCT Taiwan Premier League cricket tournament concluded at the Yingfeng Cricket Ground in Taipei’s Songshan District.
Shiv Rawat was the top scorer for PCCT. Batting at No. 6, he made 38 from 33 before he was caught by bowler Arun Parappagoudar. PCCT set Formosa 139 to win, a responsibility that captain Parappagoudar took upon himself with 50 from 44.
Formosa won by three wickets with one ball to spare after a tense final few overs.
Twelve teams entered the league, with the first match played on Jan. 2 between Formosa and the Southern Dragons in Group A, which also included ICC. Formosa won both of their group games, while ICC won one.
The Stars, the Taipei Indians and the Taiwan Dragons contested Group B, with the Stars winning two and the Indians none.
The Daredevils, the Shaheens and the Scorpions were in Group C, with the Shaheens beating the Daredevils, the Daredevils beating the Scorpions and the Scorpions defeating the Shaheens. The Shaheens did not advance due to a lower net run rate.
In Group D, PCCT won both of their matches, while the Proteas lost to them and TCA, who in that match profited from a rapid century — 117 not out by Amit Kumar Bedaka, with 10 sixes and eight fours in 61 deliveries.
The top two teams from each group advanced to the quarter-finals, where PCCT eliminated ICC, Formosa crushed TCA — with Anthony Liu blazing 10 sixes and seven fours in his undefeated 104 from 45 deliveries — the Taiwan Dragons ousted the Scorpions and the Daredevils beat the Stars.
In the qualifier match on Saturday, PCCT edged Formosa for a direct path into the final, while the Taiwan Dragons chased down a middling total by the Daredevils in the first eliminator.

           Australian Matt Jones on Saturday fired a one-under par 69 to seize a three-stroke lead over Americans J.B. Holmes and Aaron Wise after a blustery third round of the US PGA Honda Classic.
The 40-year-old from Sydney, who trailed Wise by six strokes at one stage, was the only player in the final six pairs to finish under par in windy conditions at PGA National.
“It was a very good round,” Jones said. “It was a round of trying to make as many pars as possible and limit the mistakes.
“I couldn’t win the tournament today, but I wasn’t going to lose it,” he said.
Jones stood on 10-under 200 after 54 holes at Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, with about 10,000 spectators watching under Covid-19 safety protocols.
Wise, who led by three when the day began and six after four holes, stumbled to a five-over 75 with four back-nine bogeys, plus a double bogey and a bogey on the front side to share second with Holmes, who shot 67.
“It just played really, really hard,” Wise said. “I honestly felt like I played well. The only thing I didn’t do well was manage the wind. Luckily, with how I played the first two days, I’m still in it.”
Taiwan’s C.T. Pan, among the early finishers, shared fourth on 204 with Americans Sam Ryder and Cameron Tringale.
Pan had the best round of the day, a bogey-free 5-under 65 that included three birdies on the front nine and two more at Nos. 12 and 14, before closing with four consecutive pars into the teeth of the wind.

            Demonstrators staged candle-lit protests in nearly 20 locations on Saturday night, while a group including medical workers gathered before sunrise                        Demonstrators in Myanmar yesterday maintained their unflinching opposition to military rule, despite a rising death toll at the hands of security forces as the junta appeared equally determined to resist growing outside pressure to compromise.
One man was killed and several were wounded when police opened fire on a group setting up a barricade in the central town of Monywa, a doctor there said as a community group issued a call on Facebook for blood donors.
The violence has forced people determined to resist a return to military rule after a decade of tentative steps toward democracy to think up novel ways to make their stand.
Demonstrators in nearly 20 places across the country staged candle-lit protests on Saturday night and into yesterday, from the main city of Yangon to small communities in Kachin State in the north and the southernmost town of Kawthaung, according to a tally of social media posts.
Hundreds of people in the second city, Mandalay, including many medical staff in white coats, marched before sunrise in a “Dawn protest,” video posted by the Mizzima news portal showed.
“Failure of the military regime, our cause our cause ... federal democracy, our cause our cause,” the crowd chanted as the sky was beginning to brighten.
Protesters in some places were joined by Buddhist monks holding candles, while some people used candles to make the shape of the three-fingered protest salute.
Others came out later, including the crowd in Monywa, where police opened fire.
“Sniper, sniper!” people can be heard shouting in a video clip shortly after the man was shot in the head and more shots rang out.
The spokesman for the junta was not available for comment, but has previously said security forces have used force only when necessary.
With the latest killing, the death toll since the Feb. 1 coup rose to at least to

The rally outside Grand Palace was a continuation of student-led protests that began last year and have rattled Thailand’s traditional establishment.
The rally organizers had said they planned to have demonstrators throw paper planes with messages over the palace walls.
The demonstrators, who numbered close to 1,000, broke through a barrier made of shipping containers stacked two high outside the ceremonial palace. 
Police behind the containers responded first with warnings, and then by water cannons and rubber bullets. 
Police drove the crowd back and while skirmishes continued, the crowds appeared to have dissipated by 10pm.
Bangkok’s emergency medical service, Erawan, reported that 33 people, including 13 police, were injured by rubber bullets, rocks and tear gas. 
At least two reporters were hit by rubber bullets. 
During the skirmishes, protesters tossed smoke bombs and giant firecrackers at police, and also splashed a royal portrait with paint, but failed in an attempt to set it on fire, although they did burn tires and garbage at several locations.
Police deputy spokesman Colonel Kissana Phathanacharoen said police had warned in advance that the rally was illegal. 
In addition to throwing various objects, protesters used slingshots to fire nuts and bolts at police, and hit them with metal rods, he said. 
Thai police yesterday said their actions were in accordance with international standards, and that 20 protesters were arrested for breaking public gathering laws and insulting the monarchy.
“Violence originated from the protesters’ side and police have to defend the law and protect national treasures,” Bangkok Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Piya Tavichai told reporters.
The rally was

            Sydney yesterday braced for its worst flooding in decades after record rainfall caused its largest dam to overflow and as deluges prompted mandatory mass evacuation orders along Australia’s east coast. 
Emergency services ordered people living in low-lying areas on the city’s northwestern fringes to flee to safety, as authorities warned of a potentially “life-threatening” situation in New South Wales (NSW).
It came after the Warragamba Dam, which provides much of the drinking water for Sydney, spilled over on Saturday afternoon — causing officials to warn that the downstream Hawkesbury River was expected to peak at levels not seen since 1961.
“It is one of the biggest floods we are likely to see for a very long time,” Australian Bureau of Meteorology flood operations manager Justin Robinson said.
Floodwaters had already risen in several areas, prompting mass evacuations, and officials said another 4,000 people could be told to leave their homes in the coming days.
Authorities urged residents to heed the “dozens” of official warnings in place across affected areas, with NSW State Emergency Service Assistant Commissioner Dean Storey saying those in evacuation zones “must leave immediately.”
People had already begun flocking to evacuation centers in towns north of Sydney on Saturday as torrential rains pummeled a vast coastal region already soaked by an unusually wet summer.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the region was experiencing a “one in 100 year event” and a national disaster had been declared.
In Taree, where television images showed one house floating down a bloated river, about 150 people slept in a local auditorium overnight that has previously been used a refuge for people fleeing bushfires.
Club Taree chief executive Paul Allen described the floods as a “catastrophe,” telling Australian Broadcasting Corp that some locals had “lost everything.”
The bureau said the wild weather was forecast to re-intensify north of Sydney today before easing

            In last week’s interview, publisher and historian Rene Vienet discussed his two-decade involvement with the development of nuclear power in Taiwan. Here Vienet suggests a variety of ways for Taiwan to safely recycle its nuclear waste.
The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. 
Michael Turton: The spent fuel problem. What choices does Taiwan face?
Rene Vienet: The answer, with two options, for Taiwan, may be in Switzerland, a democratic, affluent country with the highest standards and education and five nuclear reactors. The Swiss have hesitated between two options:
Option A: For part of their spent fuel, the Swiss chose to close the nuclear fuel cycle: The fuel is recycled in France at La Hague [Nuclear Recycling and Reprocessing Plant ], and the ultimate waste, the vitrified fission products, is returned to Switzerland. This long-life highly radioactive real waste is then minimal, compact and ready for passive safe storage. The remaining balance, 95 percent of the recycled used fuel rods, can then be optimized by utilities interested in mixed oxide fuel.
Option B: Interim storage of the spent fuel in dual-use casks, licensed for both transportation and storage, which do not require active cooling. 
Both A &amp; B are located between Zurich and Basel, at Zwilag Center, a must-visit place for all concerned Taiwanese legislators, reporters, etc.
MT: Okay, so how and where can we do this in Taiwan?
RV: At the southern tip of Taiwan, there is ample space in a low-density population area already belonging to Taiwan Power Company. This is the site of the Ma-anshan Nuclear Power Plant in Ma-anshan (馬鞍山) [in Pingtung County], still in operation without any problems. The site was scheduled for six reactors, so to use a quite modest portion of the available land (the area of a soccer field) would be easy, once everyone concerned in Taiwan,

George Wang (王玨) was bewildered when he was asked to play the role of Machete, a Mexican villain in the 1967 Italian spaghetti Western, Taste of Killing. The tall, dark-skinned Wang had portrayed Taiwanese Aborigines, Mongolians, Japanese and Koreans, but this would be his first non-Asian role.
He recalls in his memoir that the film studio agent showed him pictures of various Mexicans and said, “They look more Chinese than you do.” 
They shoved Wang into the audition room, where director Tonino Valerii was more than pleased with his performance. Wang recalls spending the afternoon watching two Mexican films to prepare, and then winging it. 
Wang says that he made history as the first Asian actor to play a non-Asian role in a non-Asian country. 
“Toshiro Mifune participated in foreign productions, but he always portrayed Japanese characters. Bruce Lee (李小龍) and Jackie Chan (成龍) also appeared in foreign productions, but they never portrayed foreigners. As for me, I’ve portrayed Mexcians, Arabs … I’ve also played a Confederate general in a Civil War film, and a chief from northern Africa.”
Wang, who led a daring mission in 1949 to transport all of China Motion Picture Studio’s (中國電影製作公司) equipment to Taiwan right before Shanghai fell to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), became one of Taiwan’s top actors before making it big in Italy. He starred in more than 50 Italian productions before returning to Taiwan in 1978. 
He won a Golden Horse for best supporting actor in the 1980 film The Coldest Winter in Peking (皇天后土), and was given the Special Contribution Award in 2009. At the age of 95, Wang appeared in his final production, Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai’s (王家衛) The Grandmaster (一代宗師). He died on March 27, 2015.

            Analiese Gregory is a chef who knows first-hand where her ingredients come from. Usually, it’s her hand.
Living on the wild and biodiverse Australian island of Tasmania, Gregory might be found diving for abalone one day or hunting deer the next. 
“To be able to just go into the ocean and get a sea urchin out and then just eat it, it’s like, why would we even try to do anything else here? It’s just what makes sense,” she says. Gregory is offering a view of rugged life at the bottom of the world with How Wild Things Are, a cookbook loaded with striking images of the chef herself cooking dishes at a campsite or a rocky shoreline.
The recipes reflect Gregory’s fascinating mix of refined, European-trained fine-dining skills and her knack for marrying them with the freshest ingredients of New Zealand and Australia.
“I kind of came finally to a place where I can bring a lot of the different influences together, I suppose, which I’d never used to be able to do,” she says. 	 
One page might be instructions on how to make a possum sausage and the next might be a recipe for potato gnocchi with lap cheong and kombu butter. 
Unable to source a decent piece of wallaby where you are? No problem: Gregory says everything in the book is interchangeable. Use venison or pork instead. For items she can’t hunt or forage, she prefers to buy directly from farmers.
“Take a really nice thing that you really like and then stick with things that you think will be complementary. Do kind of as little as you can to it,” she says.
Gregory was born in Auckland, New Zealand, to a Welsh father and Chinese-Dutch mother. She moved to London to work for her father, an executive chef, which led

            Lou Ottens, the Dutch inventor of the cassette tape, died on March 6 at age 94, Philips said.
A structural engineer who trained at the prestigious Technical University in Delft, the Netherlands, he joined Philips in 1952 and was head of the Dutch company’s product development department when he began work on an alternative for existing tape recorders with their cumbersome large spools of tape.
His goal was simple — make tapes and their players far more portable and easier to use.
“During the development of the cassette tape, in the early 1960s, he had a wooden block made that fit exactly in his coat pocket,” said Olga Coolen, director of the Philips Museum in the southern Netherlands city of Eindhoven. “This was how big the first compact cassette was to be, making it a lot handier than the bulky tape recorders in use at the time.” The final product created in 1962 later turned into a worldwide hit, with more than 100 billion cassettes sold, many to music fans who would record their own compilations direct from the radio. Its popularity waned with the development of the compact disc, an invention Ottens also helped create as supervisor of a development team, Philips said.
The cassette tape’s success stemmed from its simplicity, Ottens said in an interview published by the Philips Museum.
“It was a breakthrough because it was foolproof,” he said, adding that players and recorders could also run on batteries, making them very user-friendly and, ultimately, portable.

飛利浦公司表示，卡式磁帶發明人、荷蘭籍的路‧歐騰斯，已於三月六日辭世，享壽九十四歲。
歐騰斯為一名結構工程師，出身著名的荷蘭台夫特理工大學，他於一九五二年加入荷蘭飛利浦公司。他擔任飛利浦產品開發部門主管時，開始研發新產品，以代替當時使用大而笨重磁帶捲的錄音機。
他的目標很簡單，那就是把磁帶及其播放器變得更輕巧、更容易使用。
飛利浦博物館館長歐哈‧庫倫表示，「一九六?年代初，在他開發卡式磁帶期間，他做了一個木塊，大小正好可以放進他的大衣口袋」。飛利浦博物館位於荷蘭南部城市安荷芬。「這就是第一個小型卡式磁帶的大小，比當時所使用的笨重錄音機要靈巧得多」。該產品於一九六二年開發完成，後來風靡全球，所售出的卡式錄音帶逾一千億個，其中許多是賣給樂迷，讓他們可以從收音機直接把音樂錄下來，自製成合輯。飛利浦表示，隨著CD的發展，錄音帶便沒落了。歐騰斯亦為發明CD的開發團隊主管。
歐騰斯在飛利浦博物館一次採訪中說，卡式磁帶的成功在於其簡單性。
他表示：「因為它防呆，所以這是個突破」，並補充道，播放器和錄音機也可以用電池供電，這就讓它非常人性化，終究也讓它便於攜帶。

            Wu Shih-hsien, a second-grade student at Kaohsiung Municipal Youchang Junior High School, was born with achondroplasia, more commonly known as dwarfism. While only 95cm tall, Wu’s optimistic and cheerful nature has allowed him to overcome his physical disability. Last year, Wu won first prize in the music competition at the National Intellectual Disability Talent Championship for a drumming performance. Last week Wu attended a school camp, where his singing and dancing left students and teachers deeply moved. “He’s Youchang Junior High School’s little giant,” said fellow students admiringly.
Due to his physical limitations, Wu is not good at sports and running, where he has to take three steps for each step taken by anyone else. However, Wu has the courage to try his hand at everything, even having a go at rock climbing. Wu loves music most of all, and he likes drumming. Although the drum and the drumsticks are too large for him — which means he has to spend a lot of time practicing and often has to quickly recover a drumstick after dropping it mid-performance — Wu is a perfectionist and always completes the song. 
Wu was born into a single-parent family: his father left after he was born, leaving Wu’s mother to care for him on her own. When Wu was six years old, life took another cruel turn when his mother suddenly passed away. Since then, Wu  has been living with his grandmother, uncle and aunt.
Wu says he is grateful for the companionship of his teachers and classmates and says the school camp has given him many precious memories. He also says the three-day camp has made him more positive and independent and adds that although his mother could not be by his side, he wants to say to her; “Mom, I’m trying really hard.
