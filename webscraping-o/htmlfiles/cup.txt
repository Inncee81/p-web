      <h3>
       How to avoid the restrictions
      </h3>
      <p>
       There are such countries as
       <strong>
        China, Iran, Turk and Vietnam
       </strong>
       where there is access restriction to some website. In such counties, you cannot access YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc.
       <br/>
       By connecting to CUP.COM’s VPN server and doing all communication through VPN, such access restriction can be avoided.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       However, even VPN is not entirely safe, because the restrictions are getting severer. To this, CUP.COM has enhanced countermeasures from time to time; employment of one-time VPN server, VPN server abroad, undisclosed VPN server and sophisticated protocol. CUP.COM will
       <strong>
        continue such efforts
       </strong>
       .
       <br/>
       <br/>
       CUP.COM employed
       <strong>
        Tokyo and San Francisco and Singapore
       </strong>
       Server.

      <h3>
       “Static IP address”, wherever, for whatever terminals
      </h3>
      <p>
       It is possible to use CUP.COM as
       <strong>
        “static IP address”
       </strong>
       by use of feature of VPN server that its IP address is fixed.
       <br/>
       Nowadays, illegal access and manipulation of website is increasing. In plug-in for site management control, limitation that only static IP address is acceptable is very effective.
       <br/>
       VPN server is very suitable to make static IP address available, wherever, for whatever terminals.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       However, professional users may raise a question whether CUP.COM’s system is really safe, because IP address is in common among the users. It is true. So, CUP.COM added its unique function,
       <a href="limitedhost.html" target="_new">
        “limited host setting”
       </a>
       . By this, even though static IP address of the VPN is in common among the users, the address is as safe as dedicated static IP address.

       VPN protocol of OS standard, no need of software, (PPTP and L2PT/IPSec) is adopted.
       <strong>
        PPTP is simple and fast
       </strong>
       . In case that PPTP is not applicable, L2PT/IPSec is used.
       <br/>
       In case of PPTP and L2PT/IPSec, there is
       <strong>
        no need
       </strong>
       for users to install client software. These are pre-set in
       <strong>
        smart phone and tablet
       </strong>
       . You need not carry PC with you for just watching websites.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Now,
       <strong>
        ”SoftEther VPN”
       </strong>
       is applicable to CUP.COM. In this case, user is requested to install client software. ”SoftEther VPN” is strong to restrictions by authorities and routers provided by providers as incompatible to VPN.
       <br/>
       Recently
       <strong>
        ”SOCKS4/SOCKS5/Chrome extension”
