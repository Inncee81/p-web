           The jihadists are known in the area as al-Shabaab, but unlike the al-Shabaab that operates in Somalia, which is affiliated with Al Qaeda, the Mozambique group, also known as Ansar al-Sunna, is affiliated with Islamic State (ISIS).

           The terrorist insurgency threatens not only Mozambique and its people, in addition to neighboring Tanzania, which is fighting jihadists on the border; some analysts estimate that "the insurgency in Mozambique has the potential to destabilise Southern Africa and embolden Islamists throughout the region."

           Al-Shabaab jihadists leading an insurgency in Cabo Delgado, the northernmost province of Mozambique, are now beheading children as young as 11. Military and humanitarian personnel working in the area reportedly say that they have never seen anything like the brutality that the terrorists have unleashed on the region with people "often hacked to death and mutilated with machetes" as well as "mass Islamic State-style beheadings".

           Amendments to China's National Defense Law, effective the beginning of this year, take away sweeping powers from the State Council, which leads China's civilian government, and give it to the Communist Party's Central Military Commission. These powers include the power to mobilize all of society for war.
          </p>

           Everything they do, whether it is seemingly innocuous, such as measuring a mountain or putting a rover on Mars, is a means of claiming sovereignty, of enlarging the People's Republic. Now, of course, there are, in addition to these incursions, China's militant, hostile, belligerent acts.... The question is, what are we going to do about it?
          </p>

           China will land a Rover,
           <i>
            its

           Rover, on Mars in either May or June.... China's officials have been talking about moon and Mars as if they are sovereign Chinese territory -- part of the People's Republic.

           They look at near heavenly bodies the same way they do the South China Sea, something that
           <i>
            should
           </i>
           be theirs. This means that if they get there, China believes it has the right to exclude other nations.

           Today let's focus on three things that China is doing relating to genetics. First, China is collecting the world's DNA. Second, China is genetically engineering the Chinese to become a superhuman race, in other words, eugenics. Third, Chinese researchers are working on pathogens, new pathogens, artificial ones, to create the world's
           <i>
            next

           pandemic.

          <p style="color:#000000;">
           The story here is that we allowed the Chinese to plunder our society for data.

          <p style="color:#000000;">
           This whole subject was brought to the attention of the American public by John Ratcliffe, then director of National Intelligence, when he wrote that China was trying to grow super‑soldiers. Ratcliffe mentioned that China is already conducting experiments on people in the People's Liberation Army to enhance their abilities, to create, as he called it, "biologically enhanced capabilities."
          </p>

          <p style="color:#000000;">
           The Chinese regime does not have ethics or morality. It is not restrained by law. It does not have a sense of restraint. The regime is trying to create the perfect communist. China has the ability and the will to do this, which means that the world has got to prevent this experimentation.
          </p>
         </li>

           China can become number one in two ways. It can enhance its own CNP ranking by becoming stronger, or it can decrease the CNP rankings of other countries. That's where pathogens come in. This notion of decreasing CNP of others meant that China had no inhibitions about spreading the coronavirus around the world.
          </p>
         </li>
         <li style="font-size:105%; font-family:Palatino, Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif;
color:#DA0026;">
          <p style="color:#000000;">
           Now, China's ranking of CNP will increase dramatically, of course, if the next disease leaves the Chinese alone and sickens only foreigners.
          </p>
         </li>
         <li style="font-size:105%; font-family:Palatino, Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif;
color:#DA0026;">
          <p style="color:#000000;">
           The spreading of the coronavirus is indeed an application of unrestricted warfare. Many analysts have said that biological warfare does not work. I can understand why they say that, but unfortunately we have just seen a disease kill about 2.4 million people as well as hobble societies across the world.
          </p>
         </li>
         <li style="font-size:105%; font-family:Palatino, Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif;
color:#DA0026;">
          <p style="color:#000000;">
           COVID-19 is the ultimate proof that biological weapons work. If Chinese scientists actually succeed in developing viruses that attack only foreigners, China could end up as the only viable society in the world. This is communist China's weapon against the world and against the United States as well.
          </p>

          <p style="color:#000000;">
           [O]n January 20 -- just hours after taking the oath of office -- Biden issued an executive order that repealed President Trump's executive order of May 1st, 2020, preventing grid operators in the US from buying Chinese equipment. This means China is now free to sell sabotaged equipment to the US.
          </p>
         </li>
         <li style="font-size:105%; font-family:Palatino, Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif;

          <p style="color:#000000;">
           [W]e should impose costs on China for spreading COVID‑19. Recently, we passed that grim milestone of more than 500,000 deaths. This pathogen is not finished with us yet. We have to impose these costs on China to convince Xi Jinping that he cannot spread the next disease beyond his borders.
          </p>
         </li>
         <li style="font-size:105%; font-family:Palatino, Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif;
color:#DA0026;">
          <p style="color:#000000;">
           [W]e need to have the President of the United States impose costs on China for what it's doing in Hong Kong. President Trump started imposing costs but did not do enough. I hope that Biden, who ran on a campaign of trying to help the people of Hong Kong, will do so.
          </p>

          <p style="color:#000000;">
           Right now, the Chinese economy may be growing, but it did not grow at the 2.3 percent that Beijing announced for 2020. It is probably just a smidgen over zero, if it is zero.
          </p>

          <p style="color:#000000;">
           We are approaching a point where ‑‑ this will be critical ‑‑ where Biden will have to decide whether to run to the rescue of China's regime. We know that Nixon in 1972, George H.W. Bush in 1989, and Bill Clinton in 1999 rescued Chinese communism. I hope Biden does not do that a fourth time.
          </p>
         </li>

color:#DA0026;">
          <p style="color:#000000;">
           [T]he Biden team -- and they have talked about this in public -- they say, "We will impose costs on China for those things which are unacceptable, we will criticize them on others, and we will cooperate where there are common interests." I don't think we can do that because I do not see that we have common interests with a country that's trying to overthrow our government. My message is: understand the fundamental nature, the hostility, and the maliciousness of China, and remember one other thing. That is, China deliberately released the disease that has killed more than 500,000 Americans. That alone means there can be no cooperation with China.
          </p>

           We need to say this to France, to Germany, to everybody else, that this is a zero‑sum game. You either work with the US or we do not consider you to be our friend. I think Israel would choose the right side. I am not so sure about some of the other countries mentioned.... [T]his is something where American presidents have not communicated to our friends, allies, and partners how we feel about China. I say we should no longer support China's Communist regime.. We consider it to be an enemy, and we will act to protect ourselves in an appropriate fashion. Just tell Biden, in May 2019,
           <i>
            People's Daily
           </i>
           ran a piece that declared a "people's war on the US." That is all Biden should need to know.
          </p>

         <li style="font-size:105%; font-family:Palatino, Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif;

          <p style="color:#000000;">
           We know the Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and others are dying in these facilities. The only thing that separates the People's Republic of China and the Third Reich is that China has not gone to mass exterminations -- yet. This meets the definition of "genocide" in the Genocide Convention of 1948. If Biden needs another message, this is not just a policy choice for him. We are a party to that Genocide Convention, which requires signatories to "prevent and punish" acts of genocide.
          </p>
         </li>
         <li style="font-size:105%; font-family:Palatino, Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif;

          <p style="color:#000000;">
           "What should Biden do?" One of the things Secretary Pompeo said that really unnerved the Chinese was talking about in‑person diplomacy, talking to the Chinese people directly. ....Biden needs to do the same thing. Not every solution is military. As a matter of fact, our solutions with China are not military. It really starts with talking to the Chinese people.

           What does China really want?
          </p>
          <p style="padding:0; margin:0 0 10px 0;">
           Well, China really wants to rule planet Earth. It also wants to possess and rule the near portions of the solar system. No, I am not exaggerating. No nation in history has been this ambitious.

           With regard to our planet, Xi Jinping wants the world to reject the current Westphalian international system, in place since 1648. In its place, he wants China's imperial-era system, where Chinese emperors believed they not only had the right to rule
           <i>

           </i>
           , all under heaven, but also the heavens compelled them to do so.
          </p>
          <p style="padding:0; margin:0 0 10px 0;">
           Xi has been grabbing territory from his neighbors. In just the past few months, the Chinese have been encroaching on India's Sikkim as well as Nepalese territory.

           "Muslims do not want democracy. Anyone who says democratic republic is an enemy of Islam. All our miseries are caused by those who demand freedom. They want to build a Western society for Muslims in which you are free and independent but without a God, a prophet, or Imam.

           In other words, One God does not mean One Leader or one party or one policy. Such a claim would be a form of "

           (recommendation or injunction). Contrary to what he imagines, it doesn't mean propaganda forced down people's throats by a totalitarian state. All it means is giving advice, offering alternative readings of issues, gently guiding fellow-believers toward the right path without sending General Soleimani with a machine-gun in one hand and a Samsonite full of dollars in the other.

           The Pope's brief tête-à-tête with Grand Ayatollah Ali-Mohammad Sistani in Najaf opened a wide-ranging debate about the nature and future of Shiite Islam. The fact that the Pope called on Sistani at the latter's home clearly irritated the Khomeinist circles in Tehran. Their irritation morphed into thinly disguised rage when the Vatican described Sistani as "spiritual leader of the Shiite community."

           There are several exceptions to this cancel culture rule. You can say almost anything negative about Jews, as evidenced by the recent Grammy awards, during which three overt anti-Semites were honored. These bigots did not even try to disguise their anti-Semitism behind the facade of anti-Zionism.

           Slate — the online magazine known for its provocative content—has indefinitely suspended one of its star podcasters, Mike Peska, for debating with a colleague, on an inter-office messaging platform, whether it is ever appropriate for a non-Black person to use the N-word in the context of a discussion about race. It is not clear whether in the course of the discussion Peska actually uttered the word itself or just used the term "n-word."

          <p style="padding:0; margin:0 0 10px 0;">
           In defending Slate's decision, a Black staffer argued that "For Black employees, it's an extremely small ask to not hear that particular slur and not have debate about whether it's OK for white employees to use that particular slur." Not have debate?

           In 2003 alone, 344 Palestinian families were forcibly expelled from their homes [in Iraq] by militias. Between 2003 and 2016, an estimated 300 Palestinian refugees were killed by these militias.... Palestinians have been demonized even in social media posts as potential 'terrorists' by accounts linked to the [Iraqi] interior ministry." —

           The international reaction would, of course, have been completely different if Israel taken such measures against Palestinians. Evidently, no one really does care about the plight of the Palestinians. They are only cared about if they can be made to appear as victims of Israel, never of an Arab country.

           Palestinian leaders are much too busy attacking Israel and demanding that the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecute Israelis for alleged "war crimes" against the Palestinians to notice the suffering of Palestinians at the hands of an Arab country.

           The ICC, which appears obsessed with Israel, is unlikely to launch an investigation into Iraq's ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. Likewise, the United Nations Security Council is unlikely to hold an emergency session to denounce Iraq for its discriminatory measures against the Palestinians. The international media, for its part, will also continue their usually venomous -- and usually unjustified -- attacks on Israel, while ignoring the horrendous treatment the Palestinians receive from their Arab brothers.

           Here are just a few of the more egregious federal power grabs in H.R.1 concocted against the 50 states that run elections under the U.S. Constitution: 1. Ban voter ID laws and allow ballot harvesting; 2. Expand Election Day to "election season" by mandating mail-in ballots be counted 10 days after the election would normally be over; and, 3. Automatic voter registration of people who apply for unemployment, Medicaid, Obamacare, and college, or who are coming out of prison. There is a lot more, and it gets worse. Substantially worse. There are First Amendment restrictions on political speech.

           H.R.1 -- the so-called "For the People Act" -- is nearly 800 pages of meritless, militant, social engineering targeting the foundations of the U.S. Constitution, voting rights and political free speech -- all dressed-up as being "for the people."

           A lot has been written about H.R.1 -- the so-called "For the People Act of 2021." Former Vice President Mike Pence has opined on the bill. The Editorial Board of the

            Wall Street Journal

           sounded the alarm back in January. The editors of National Review come right out and call it a "partisan assault on American democracy."

          <p style="padding:0; margin:0 0 10px 0;">
           H.R.1 purports to, "expand Americans' access to the ballot box, reduce the influence of big money in politics, strengthen ethics rules for public servants, and implement other anti-corruption measures for the purpose of fortifying our democracy, and for other purposes." The Bill is 791 pages long.

           The media's suspicion of the illegitimate use of violence by the police is so intense that officers under attack do not even feel permitted to use their weapon

           On January 25 in Pantin, a suburb of Paris, on February 4 in Carcassonne in the south of France, and on February 13 in Poissy in Yvelines, organized groups of "young people" -- according to the established media vocabulary to avoid any ethnic designation -- lured police forces into their neighborhoods to ambush them. To the shouts of "Kill them; kill them all", police patrols were attacked with explosives and pyrotechnic devices used as urban guerrilla weapons. Each time, videos of the attack were broadcast on social networks.

           We see Xi's new demands in his intransigent position going into Thursday's meeting in Anchorage. China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, and his subordinate, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, look as if they are going to Alaska not to engage in meaningful discussion, but to lecture Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and to dictate the terms of the relationship going forward.

           Yang's unpleasant February 5 telephone call with Blinken is a warning of Xi Jinping's new no-compromise attitude.

           Chinese leaders set a goal to dominate tech, and they have employed every tool at their disposal. They will stop at nothing to own the tech of tomorrow because they understand that tech dominance will give them economic and geopolitical dominance as well.

           Tech giants, such as Microsoft, that helped China develop facial-recognition systems to control racial minorities, apparently have no qualms about helping the Communist Party commit crimes against humanity.... It is up to Washington to prevent the tech giants from enriching and strengthening a hostile Chinese regime.

           The way to free Hong Kong, ultimately, is to end the Communist Party. Once the territory is free, its people can decide whether to seek sovereign status.

           Xi Jinping now has, in President Biden, the American leader he has always wanted. Biden with his executive orders and other actions has so far given China many gifts and has asked for nothing in return. Among these unilateral concessions are his lifting a ban on Chinese electrical equipment, postponing rules against investments in China's military-linked companies, rejoining the Beijing-dominated World Health Organization, and delaying prohibitions on Chinese apps.

          <p style="padding:0; margin:0 0 10px 0;">
           As a result of receiving so many free gifts from Biden, Xi seems more arrogant and is demanding even more.

           What Erdoğan diplomatically refers to as "common interests" are in reality a list of Turkish demands: 1) Remove Turkey from the CAATSA list. 2) Allow Turkey to activate its Russian-made air defense architecture. 3) Ignore the Turkish public bank's role in violating U.S. sanctions on Iran. 4) End the U.S. alliance with Syrian Kurds and allow Turkey to crush them. 5) Praise, do not criticize, Turkey's democratic record.

           U.S. President Joe Biden's two predecessors, Donald Trump and Barack Obama, made the same mistake, though for different reasons. They both mishandled Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his increasingly Islamization of Turkey's secular lifestyle, education system, politics and institutions. Obama apparently hoped that Turkey's post-modern Islamists could be an example to less-democratic Islamic regimes in the Middle East. Trump, on the other hand, seemed not to care if his pro-Erdoğan overtures emboldened Turkey's Islamist strongman and simultaneously weakened the NATO ally's ties with the West and Western institutions.

           [T]he Houthis have also used the sophisticated weaponry they have received from Iran, such as drones and ballistic missiles, to broaden the conflict into neighbouring Saudi Arabia, which is leading the coalition military campaign to re-establish Yemen's democratically-elected government.
          </p>

          <p style="color:#000000;">
           [US sanctions were] promptly denounced by humanitarian and aid agencies, which claimed that designating the Houthis as terrorists would impede the global effort to help Yemen's starving population, an argument that appears perverse as the Houthis control most of the key aid supply routes, and regularly steal aid supplies to sell on the black market and fund their terrorist operations.
          </p>
         </li>
         <li style="font-size:105%; font-family:Palatino, Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif;
color:#DA0026;">
          <p style="color:#000000;">
           So far this month the Houthis have launched more than 20 drone and missile attacks against predominantly civilian targets in Saudi Arabia. In the most high profile attack, the Houthis used an explosive-laden drone and a ballistic missile against the Saudi petroleum plant at Ras Tanura, prompting global oil prices to rise above $70 a barrel earlier this week, its highest in more than a year.
          </p>
         </li>
         <li style="font-size:105%; font-family:Palatino, Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif;
color:#DA0026;">
          <p style="color:#000000;">
           Mr Biden has indicated he is keen to revive the controversial nuclear deal with Iran and, by easing the pressure on the Houthis, whose success on the battlefield is entirely due to the weapons and support they receive from Tehran, the White House was hoping to send a message to Iran that it was serious about having a constructive dialogue with Tehran. Instead, in the weeks since Mr Biden lifted the FTO, the region has seen a significant increase in Houthi activity.
          </p>

color:#DA0026;">
          <p style="color:#000000;">
           [B]y helping to facilitate these attacks by providing the Houthis with sophisticated weapons, Tehran is showing that, far from seeking improved relations with the new US administration, it remains committed to pursuing an uncompromising policy of aggression throughout the Middle East, one that is unlikely to result in the resumption of talks on the problematic issue of Iran's nuclear programme anytime soon.

           US President Joe Biden has good reason to regret his hasty decision to remove the terrorist designation applied to the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen after they responded to his act of benevolence by unleashing a fresh wave of attacks in the Middle East.
          </p>
          <p style="padding:0; margin:0 0 10px 0;">
           The Houthis and their Iranian backers are primarily responsible for starting Yemen's long and bitter civil war after they overthrew the democratically-elected government of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi in 2014.
          </p>
          <p style="padding:0; margin:0 0 10px 0;">
           Apart from helping to create what the UN has called the world's worst humanitarian disaster, the Houthis have also used the sophisticated weaponry they have received from Iran, such as drones and ballistic missiles, to broaden the conflict into neighbouring Saudi Arabia, which is leading the coalition military campaign to re-establish Yemen's democratically-elected government.

           Belarus "is not a member of the Council of Europe – it still has the death penalty which is an automatic bar to its membership. This means that it is not subject to... requirements... to bring its prison system in line with the norms outlined in the European Prison Rules.... All prisoners are vulnerable to their treatment in custody being manipulated at the behest of investigators to exact confessions and witness statements from them. The lack of transparency of the Belarus prison service is almost absolute." — Judith Pallot, Director of the GULAGECHOES project at the University of Helsinki, Open Democracy, November 20, 2020.

           The US has "designated" several individuals and entities in Belarus for their role in undermining democracy and human rights abuses. The EU has also imposed several rounds of sanctions against high-level officials.... It is up for debate, however, whether sanctions have any effect on the leadership of Belarus, especially because Belarus largely relies on Russia, not the West.... "The individuals on the list don't care about being on it. On the contrary, they consider it a medal of honor." — Artyom Shraibman, a political analyst based in Minsk, politico.eu, September 19, 2020.

           It has been six months since protests began in Belarus against the authoritarian regime of President Alexander Lukashenko and the unfree elections that took place there on August 9, 2020. Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since he came into power in 1994, has cracked down violently on the still ongoing protests, in which police have detained more than 33,000 people.

Accordingly, the allegations that the presidential elections were not transparent, free or fair were found confirmed."

           The composition of the current negotiating team, similar to the previous one, completely excludes those on Iran's doorstep. In an approach reminiscent of the bygone colonial era, it remains a policy set by governments thousands of miles away.

           Arab nations have already seen the consequences of the previous attempt at striking a nuclear deal. The Iranian-armed Houthis simply ratcheted up efforts to cause death and destruction in Yemen, and Hezbollah escalated its involvement and control of large swathes of Syrian territory.

           The Biden administration, deep down, unfortunately seems to wish to forge ahead with its agenda to revive the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) -- also known as the Iran nuclear deal, which, incidentally, Iran never signed -- and subsequently to lift sanctions against Tehran.

           This is why many, even among the critics of the regime, insist that showing any interest in this year's presidential election, slated for June, is not only a waste of time but active participation in a massive political deception.

           Today the pro-US faction, also backed by Britain, still hopes to revive the scenario by fielding a candidate in June. But that would require a much bigger effort by President Joe Biden to inject massive cash into Iran's morbid economy, grant major diplomatic concessions to the "New York Boys" and contribute to creating a feel-good atmosphere.

           Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's presidency ends like the scene of a car crash. With the official inflation rate at over 50 percent, unemployment hovering over 25 percent and over 40 percent of Iranians pushed under the official poverty line, talk of "hope" seems indecent to say the least.

           "Not worth a bucketful of spit!" This is how US President Harry Truman described the vice-presidency when he himself filled that slot under President Roosevelt.

           How relevant are such analyses?

          <p style="padding:0; margin:0 0 10px 0;">
           To be sure, the system put in place by the late Ayatollah Ruhallah Khomeini and his group could be anything but republican. In fact, what we have in Iran today is a form of "Imamate" of the kind existed in North Yemen under the Hamidi imams. During the 1978-79 revolts against Iran's constitutional monarchy, neither Khomeini nor any of his closest associates spoke of a republican system.

         Bahareh Hedayat is a human rights activist who has spent over six years in an Iranian prison for "insulting" Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and for "actions against national security, propagation of falsehoods, mutiny and illegal congregation." Hedayat is the longest serving female prisoner of conscience in Iran.
