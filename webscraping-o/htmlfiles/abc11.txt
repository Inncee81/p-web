Fuquay Varina would strike first Kayden Castle to Ethan Burke. Bengals up seven nothing.

Holly Springs would answer, Dylan Waskey up the middle-field and we're tied at seven apiece.

Into the second half, Golden Hawk quarterback Brock Wills to Tyler Griffin for a 45-yard touchdown pass Golden Hawks go ahead.

The Bengals would answer.  Castle, again, finding Ethan Burke on a 45-yard bomb... the Bengals closing in but Holly Springs would pull away.

Wills with a quick toss to Addison Carlson on the jet sweep and finds rumbling right into your highlights.
