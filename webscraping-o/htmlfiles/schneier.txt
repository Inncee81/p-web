         Easy SMS Hijacking
        </a>
       </h2>
       <p>
        Vice is
        <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3g8wb/hacker-got-my-texts-16-dollars-sakari-netnumber">
         reporting
        </a>
        on a cell phone vulnerability caused by commercial SMS services. One of the things these services permit is text message forwarding. It turns out that with a little bit of anonymous money — in this case, $16 off an anonymous prepaid credit card — and a few lies, you can forward the text messages from any phone to any other phone.
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         For businesses, sending text messages to hundreds, thousands, or perhaps millions of customers can be a laborious task. Sakari streamlines that process by letting business customers import their own number. A
         <a href="https://beetexting.com/">
          wide ecosystem of these companies exist
         </a>
         , each advertising their own ability to run text messaging for other businesses. Some firms say they only allow customers to reroute messages for business landlines or VoIP phones, while others allow mobile numbers too.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sakari offers a free trial to anyone wishing to see what the company’s dashboard looks like. The cheapest plan, which allows customers to add a phone number they want to send and receive texts as, is where the $16 goes. Lucky225 provided Motherboard with screenshots of Sakari’s interface, which show a red “+” symbol where users can add a number.
        </p>
        <p>
         While adding a number, Sakari provides the Letter of Authorization for the user to sign. Sakari’s LOA says that the user should not conduct any unlawful, harassing, or inappropriate behaviour with the text messaging service and phone number.
        </p>
        <p>
         But as Lucky225 showed, a user can just sign up with someone else’s number and receive their text messages instead.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        This is much easier than SMS hijacking, and causes the same security vulnerabilities. Too many networks use SMS as an authentication mechanism.
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Once the hacker is able to reroute a target’s text messages, it can then be trivial to hack into other accounts associated with that phone number. In this case, the hacker sent login requests to Bumble, WhatsApp, and Postmates, and easily accessed the accounts.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Don’t focus too much on the particular company in this article.
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         But Sakari is only one company. And there are plenty of others available in this overlooked industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tuketu said that after one provider cut-off their access, “it took us two minutes to find another.”

         Exploiting Spectre Over the Internet
        </a>
       </h2>
       <p>
        Google has
        <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/03/a-spectre-proof-of-concept-for-spectre.html">
         demonstrated
        </a>
        exploiting the
        <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2018/01/spectre_and_mel.html">
         Spectre CPU attack
        </a>
        remotely over the web:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Today, we’re sharing proof-of-concept (PoC) code that confirms the practicality of Spectre exploits against JavaScript engines. We use Google Chrome to demonstrate our attack, but these issues are not specific to Chrome, and we expect that other modern browsers are similarly vulnerable to this exploitation vector. We have developed an interactive demonstration of the attack available at
         <a href="https://leaky.page">
          https://leaky.page/
         </a>
         ; the code and a more detailed writeup are published on Github
         <a href="https://github.com/google/security-research-pocs/tree/master/spectre.js">
          here
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         The demonstration website can leak data at a speed of 1kB/s when running on Chrome 88 on an Intel Skylake CPU. Note that the code will likely require minor modifications to apply to other CPUs or browser versions; however, in our tests the attack was successful on several other processors, including the Apple M1 ARM CPU, without any major changes.

         Illegal Content and the Blockchain
        </a>
       </h2>
       <p>
        Security researchers have recently discovered a botnet with a novel defense against takedowns. Normally, authorities can disable a botnet by taking over its command-and-control server. With nowhere to go for instructions, the botnet is rendered useless. But over the years, botnet designers have come up with ways to make this counterattack harder. Now the content-delivery network Akamai has
        <a href="https://blogs.akamai.com/sitr/2021/02/bitcoins-blockchains-and-botnets.html">
         reported
        </a>
        on a new method: a botnet that uses the Bitcoin blockchain ledger. Since the blockchain is globally accessible and hard to take down, the botnet’s operators appear to be safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        It’s best to avoid explaining the mathematics of Bitcoin’s blockchain, but to understand the colossal implications here, you need to understand one concept. Blockchains are a type of “distributed ledger”: a record of all transactions since the beginning, and everyone using the blockchain needs to have access to — and reference — a copy of it. What if someone puts illegal material in the blockchain? Either everyone has a copy of it, or the blockchain’s security fails.
       </p>
       <p>
        To be fair, not absolutely everyone who uses a blockchain holds a copy of the entire ledger. Many who buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum don’t bother using the ledger to verify their purchase. Many don’t actually hold the currency outright, and instead trust an exchange to do the transactions and hold the coins. But people need to continually verify the blockchain’s history on the ledger for the system to be secure. If they stopped, then it would be trivial to forge coins. That’s how the system works.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some years ago, people
        <a href="http://www.righto.com/2014/02/ascii-bernanke-wikileaks-photographs.html">
         started noticing
        </a>
        all sorts of things embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain. There are digital images, including one of Nelson Mandela. There’s the Bitcoin logo, and the original paper describing Bitcoin by its alleged founder, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. There are advertisements, and several prayers. There’s even
        <a href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-33/accenture-editing-uneditable-blockchain.pdf">
         illegal pornography and leaked classified documents
        </a>
        . All of these were put in by anonymous Bitcoin users. But none of this, so far, appears to seriously threaten those in power in governments and corporations. Once someone adds something to the Bitcoin ledger, it becomes sacrosanct. Removing something requires a fork of the blockchain, in which Bitcoin fragments into multiple parallel cryptocurrencies (and associated blockchains). Forks happen, rarely, but never yet because of legal coercion. And repeated forking would destroy Bitcoin’s stature as a stable(ish) currency.
       </p>
       <p>
        The botnet’s designers are using this idea to create an unblockable means of coordination, but the implications are much greater. Imagine someone using this idea to evade government censorship.

       <p>
        What if someone added a type of political speech that Singapore routinely censors? Or cartoons that Disney holds the copyright to?
       </p>
       <p>
        In Bitcoin’s and most other public blockchains there are no central, trusted authorities. Anyone in the world can perform transactions or become a miner. Everyone is equal to the extent that they have the hardware and electricity to perform cryptographic computations.
       </p>
       <p>
        This openness is also a vulnerability, one that opens the door to asymmetric threats and small-time malicious actors. Anyone can put information in the one and only Bitcoin blockchain. Again, that’s how the system works.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the last three decades, the world has witnessed the power of open networks:
        <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3356098">
         blockchains
        </a>
        , social media, the very web itself. What makes them so powerful is that their value is related not just to the number of users, but
        <em>
         the number of potential links between users
        </em>
        . This is Metcalfe’s law — value in a network is quadratic, not linear, in the number of users — and every open network since has followed its prophecy.
       </p>
       <p>
        As Bitcoin has grown, its monetary value has skyrocketed, even if its
        <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/theres-no-good-reason-to-trust-blockchain-technology">
         uses remain unclear
        </a>
        . With no barrier to entry, the blockchain space has been a Wild West of innovation and lawlessness. But today, many prominent advocates suggest Bitcoin should become a global, universal currency. In this context, asymmetric threats like embedded illegal data become a major challenge.
       </p>
       <p>
        The philosophy behind Bitcoin traces to the earliest days of the open internet. Articulated in John Perry Barlow’s 1996
        <a href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence">
         Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace
        </a>
        , it was and is the ethos of tech startups: Code is more trustworthy than institutions. Information is meant to be free, and nobody has the right — and should not have the ability — to control it.
       </p>
       <p>
        But information must reside somewhere. Code is written by and for people, stored on computers located within countries, and embedded within the institutions and societies we have created. To trust information is to
        <a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/p/the-pandemic-heroes-who-gave-us-the">
         trust its chain of custody
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/p/lessons-from-a-pandemic-anniversary">
         social context
        </a>
        it
        <a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/p/critical-thinking-isnt-just-a-process">
         comes from
        </a>
        . Neither code nor information is value-neutral, nor ever free of human context.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, Barlow’s vision is a mere shadow; every society controls the information its people can access. Some of this control is through overt censorship, as China controls information about Taiwan, Tiananmen Square, and the Uyghurs. Some of this is through civil laws designed by the powerful for their benefit, as with Disney and US copyright law, or UK libel law.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bitcoin and blockchains like it are on a collision course with these laws. What happens when the interests of the powerful, with the law on their side, are pitted against an open blockchain? Let’s imagine how our various scenarios might play out.
       </p>
       <p>
        China first: In response to Falun Gong texts in the blockchain, the People’s Republic decrees that any miners processing blocks with banned content will be taken offline — their IPs will be blacklisted. This causes a hard fork of the blockchain at the point just before the banned content. China might do this under the guise of a “patriotic” messaging campaign, publicly stating that it’s merely maintaining financial sovereignty from Western banks. Then it uses paid influencers and moderators on social media to pump the China Bitcoin fork, through both partisan comments and transactions. Two distinct forks would soon emerge, one behind China’s Great Firewall and one outside. Other countries with similar governmental and media ecosystems — Russia, Singapore, Myanmar — might consider following suit, creating multiple national Bitcoin forks. These would operate independently, under mandates to censor unacceptable transactions from then on.
       </p>
       <p>
        Disney’s approach would play out differently. Imagine the company announces it will sue any ISP that hosts copyrighted content, starting with networks hosting the biggest miners. (Disney has sued to enforce its intellectual property rights in China before.) After some legal pressure, the networks cut the miners off. The miners reestablish themselves on another network, but Disney keeps the pressure on. Eventually miners get pushed further and further off of mainstream network providers, and resort to tunneling their traffic through an anonymity service like Tor. That causes a major slowdown in the already slow (because of the mathematics) Bitcoin network. Disney might issue takedown requests for Tor exit nodes, causing the network to slow to a crawl. It could persist like this for a long time without a fork. Or the slowdown could cause people to jump ship, either by forking Bitcoin or switching to another cryptocurrency without the copyrighted content.
       </p>
       <p>
        And then there’s illegal pornographic content and leaked classified data. These have
        <a href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-33/accenture-editing-uneditable-blockchain.pdf">
         been on
        </a>
        the Bitcoin blockchain for over five years, and nothing has been done about it. Just like the botnet example, it may be that these do not threaten existing power structures enough to warrant takedowns. This could easily change if Bitcoin becomes a popular way to share child sexual abuse material. Simply having these illegal images on your hard drive is a felony, which could have significant repercussions for anyone involved in Bitcoin.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whichever scenario plays out, this may be the Achilles heel of Bitcoin as a global currency.
       </p>
       <p>
        If an open network such as a blockchain were threatened by a powerful organization — China’s censors, Disney’s lawyers, or the FBI trying to take down a more dangerous botnet — it could fragment into multiple networks. That’s not just a nuisance, but an existential risk to Bitcoin.
       </p>
       <p>
        Suppose Bitcoin were fragmented into 10 smaller blockchains, perhaps by geography: one in China, another in the US, and so on. These fragments might retain their original users, and by ordinary logic, nothing would have changed. But Metcalfe’s law implies that the overall value of these blockchain fragments
        <em>
         combined
        </em>
        would be a mere tenth of the original. That is because the value of an open network relates to how many others you can communicate with — and, in a blockchain, transact with. Since the security of bitcoin currency is achieved through expensive computations, fragmented blockchains are also easier to attack in a conventional manner — through a 51 percent attack — by an organized attacker. This is especially the case if the smaller blockchains all use the same hash function, as they would here.
       </p>
       <p>
        Traditional currencies are generally not vulnerable to these sorts of asymmetric threats. There are no viable small-scale attacks against the US dollar, or almost any other fiat currency. The institutions and beliefs that
        <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/423/the-invention-of-money">
         give money its value
        </a>
        are deep-seated, despite instances of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation#Notable_hyperinflationary_periods">
         currency hyperinflation
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The only notable attacks against fiat currencies are in the form of counterfeiting. Even in the past, when counterfeit bills were common, attacks
        <a href="https://time.com/3774327/lincoln-history-secret-service">
         could be thwarted
        </a>
        . Counterfeiters require specialized equipment and are vulnerable to law enforcement discovery and arrest. Furthermore, most money today — even if it’s nominally in a fiat currency — doesn’t exist in paper form.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bitcoin attracted a following for its openness and immunity from government control. Its goal is to create a world that replaces cultural power with cryptographic power: verification in code, not trust in people. But there is no such world. And today, that feature is a vulnerability. We really don’t know what will happen when the human systems of trust come into conflict with the trustless verification that make blockchain currencies unique. Just last week we saw
        <a href="https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1365844883756314627">
         this exact attack
        </a>
        on smaller blockchains — not Bitcoin yet. We are watching a public socio-technical experiment in the making, and we will witness its success or failure in the not-too-distant future.

         On the Insecurity of ES&amp;S Voting Machines’ Hash Code
        </a>
       </h2>
       <p>
        Andrew Appel and Susan Greenhalgh have a
        <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2021/03/05/voting-machine-hashcode-testing-unsurprisingly-insecure-and-surprisingly-insecure/">
         blog post
        </a>
        on the insecurity of ES&amp;S’s software authentication system:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         It turns out that ES&amp;S has bugs in their hash-code checker:
         <b>
          if the “reference hashcode” is completely missing, then it’ll say “yes, boss, everything is fine” instead of reporting an error.
         </b>
         It’s simultaneously
         <b>
          shocking
         </b>
         and
         <b>
          unsurprising
         </b>
         that ES&amp;S’s hashcode checker could contain such a blunder and that it would go unnoticed by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission’s federal certification process. It’s unsurprising because testing naturally tends to focus on “does the system work right when used as intended?”  Using the system in unintended ways (which is what hackers would do) is not something anyone will notice.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Also:
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         Another gem in Mr. Mechler’s report is in Section 7.1, in which he reveals that acceptance testing of voting systems is done by the
         <i>
          vendor
         </i>
         , not by the customer.  Acceptance testing is the process by which a customer checks a delivered product to make sure it satisfies requirements.  To have the vendor do acceptance testing pretty much defeats the purpose.

          Abstract:
         </b>
         Overnight, Apple has turned its hundreds-of-million-device ecosystem into the world’s largest crowd-sourced location tracking network called offline finding (OF). OF leverages online finder devices to detect the presence of missing offline devices using Bluetooth and report an approximate location back to the owner via the Internet. While OF is not the first system of its kind, it is the first to commit to strong privacy goals. In particular, OF aims to ensure finder anonymity, untrackability of owner devices, and confidentiality of location reports. This paper presents the first comprehensive security and privacy analysis of OF. To this end, we recover the specifications of the closed-source OF protocols by means of reverse engineering. We experimentally show that unauthorized access to the location reports allows for accurate device tracking and retrieving a user’s top locations with an error in the order of 10 meters in urban areas. While we find that OF’s design achieves its privacy goals, we discover two distinct design and implementation flaws that can lead to a location correlation attack and unauthorized access to the location history of the past seven days, which could deanonymize users. Apple has partially addressed the issues following our responsible disclosure. Finally, we make our research artifacts publicly available.

         But we can go beyond the polarization of electrons and really leverage the electron waviness. By interleaving thin layers of superconducting and normal materials, we can make the quantum electronic equivalents of transistors and diodes such as Superconducting Tunnel Junctions (SJTs) and Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (affectionately known as SQUIDs). These devices take full advantage of the wave-like nature of electrons and can be used as building blocks for all sorts of novel electronics.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because of the superconducting requirement, they need to be kept very cold, but quantum electronics have already revolutionized precision measurement. The most visible application has been in measuring the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Observations of the CMB have shown that we live in an expanding Universe, determined the age of our Universe, and identified the fraction of it composed of dark matter and dark energy. Measurements of the CMB have transformed our understanding of the Universe we live in. These measurements have been largely enabled by SQUIDs and related superconducting electronics in their microwave cameras.

         “Exploitation and Sanitization of Hidden Data in PDF Files”

        <p>
         <b>
          Abstract:
         </b>
         Organizations publish and share more and more electronic documents like PDF files. Unfortunately, most organizations are unaware that these documents can compromise sensitive information like authors names, details on the information system and architecture. All these information can be exploited easily by attackers to footprint and later attack an organization. In this paper, we analyze hidden data found in the PDF files published by an organization. We gathered a corpus of 39664 PDF files published by 75 security agencies from 47 countries. We have been able to measure the quality and quantity of information exposed in these PDF files. It can be effectively used to find weak links in an organization: employees who are running outdated software. We have also measured the adoption of PDF files sanitization by security agencies. We identified only 7 security agencies which sanitize few of their PDF files before publishing. Unfortunately, we were still able to find sensitive information within 65% of these sanitized PDF files. Some agencies are using weak sanitization techniques: it requires to remove all the hidden sensitive information from the file and not just to remove the data at the surface. Security agencies need to change their sanitization methods.
