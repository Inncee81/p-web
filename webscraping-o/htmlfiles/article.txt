We say it\u0026rsquo;s the sofa. The sofa is where your brain can switch into relaxation mode after a long day at work. It\u0026rsquo;s where your family gathers to connect over a favorite movie. Your sofa is the place you congregate with your best friends and a bottle of wine when one of you is going through a rough time.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eBesides being a major part of your daily life, your sofa is also a major aesthetic statement. You need your modern couch to provide comfortable seating, but you also need it to look amazing. Let\u0026rsquo;s explore how you can get the best of both worlds.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eLeather Sofas\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eMid century leather sofas have come a long way. What used to be the certified \u0026lsquo;dad spot\u0026rsquo; in the dark corner of a musty basement is now a stylish statement piece you\u0026rsquo;re thrilled to show off on Instagram. Buttery soft, easy to clean, and in countless styles and colors, a modern leather sofa is a timeless piece that\u0026rsquo;ll only gets better with age.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eHow do you get the picture-perfect space you\u0026rsquo;ve been dreaming of? You find the leather that\u0026rsquo;s right for you. Different lifestyles, tastes, and needs will dictate the different type of leather you want your contemporary sofa to be made of. Fear not: there\u0026rsquo;s something for everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eDo you love the look of a worn-in pair of vintage cowboy boots? Does your home give off natural, earthy vibes? An aniline leather sofa has your name on it. Aniline who? Aniline leather uses no pigment and has no corrections. This means all the natural markings and color variations are yours to enjoy. You\u0026rsquo;ll also get a unique patina over time.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want a slightly more uniform look, a semi-aniline leather sofa is your jam. This type of leather has a thin layer of wax applied after the dying process which also makes it less porous and less susceptible to stains and damage. Kids, pets, and wine spills: we\u0026rsquo;re not as afraid of you.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eFabric Sofas\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s something so familiar about a contemporary fabric sofa. Chances are, you grew up with one. Today, you can emulate that same warmth and feeling of home with an updated version of a tried and true piece.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eFabric sofas come in a variety of pattern, material, and color choices so you can easily find a piece that suits your existing space.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWhen choosing a modern fabric sofa, consider your lifestyle, space, and design aesthetic. Do you have a tiny condo with minimal character? A mid-century sofa in a light grey fabric will keep things light. Are you drawn to drama and conversation pieces? An orange sofa adds a punch of personality. Whether you want to create a calming retreat or an energizing environment, a fabric sofa can take you there.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eVelvet Sofas\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003ePicture The Great Gatsby, but with less scandal. Modern velvet sofas are the perfect backdrop to an evening of vintage cocktails, cigar smoke, and retro hors d\u0027oeuvres. Their plush texture can also elevate an evening at home with a microwave pizza and a saucy made-for-TV movie. Either or.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eVelvet sofas add a touch of luxury to a space \u0026mdash; but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean they have to feel stuffy. Velvet can work in a kids bedroom or a boho loft just as well as in a formal living room in the Hamptons. The trick is knowing how to style your velvet; add playful cushions or throws to a velvet sofa to bring down the glam factor. Mixing natural materials with your velvet \u0026mdash; such as a wooden coffee table, organic bamboo tray, or handmade ceramic vase \u0026mdash; can also help if you\u0026rsquo;re going for a more casual look.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIf you do want to dial up the luxury with your velvet sofa, decor details such a fluffy sheepskin throw, gold or brass accents, and materials such as marble create a high-end look.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eA home without a sofa is just a house. Cuddling up in bed to watch TV is cute, but asking your bookclub to gather on your king bed is a different story. The right sofa for your space and lifestyle doesn\u0026rsquo;t just give you seating. It gives you the space to refuel after a difficult parent-teacher conference, the place where laughter is currency, and where your most important memories are born.

As such, they\u0026rsquo;ve got to play some pretty serious double duty. When you\u0026rsquo;re choosing between modern dining chairs, keep an eye to the overarching style of your home and try to echo it in the shape of your chosen dining chair set. You\u0026rsquo;ll be happy you took the time when you\u0026rsquo;re hauling two extra chairs into the living room on Superbowl Sunday.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eMis-matchy dining chairs\u003cbr /\u003eMismatched contemporary dining chairs are a great way of adding drama or spark. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking to have a few different styles of chairs around your table, there are some factors that will keep your selections looking eclectic but put-together.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eLegs first. The shape of the chair legs will go a long way in creating cohesion. In general, the thinner the leg, the more airy and contemporary the chair style. A heavy, thick leg typically imbues a space with a more traditional feel.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWhile color is personal and specific to space, color consistency helps to create visual cohesion. If you plan to go with mismatched chairs, a controlled palette will keep the mismatched chairs subtle. Want something more \u0026ldquo;medium-subtle?\u0026rdquo; Stick to a single shape and vary the colors, or to one bold color, going crazy with shape. For utter maximalism, just pick any chair at all \u0026mdash; but make sure that the seat is 10-inches from the bottom of the table. Sacrificing function for style seems like a great idea until your BFF\u0026rsquo;s new boyfriend can\u0026rsquo;t pull his seat up to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eWhen everyone\u0026rsquo;s clinking glasses and ready to tuck into dinner, your dining chair selection probably won\u0026rsquo;t be top of mind. It\u0026rsquo;s simply another thoughtful element of your home. Of course, your home is a sum of its parts, and the effort put into making the space reflect your family doesn\u0026rsquo;t go unnoticed.

Sleek, tall, and unflaggingly stylish, a contemporary bar table is a great way to inject function that looks 100% fashion into your dining space. We\u0026rsquo;ve put together a handy little guide to help you determine what you need out of your bar table.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eTable the discussion\u003cbr /\u003eA true bar table is typically counter height, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need to consider what kind of chairs will work with your pick. Carefully read and measure the height of your preferred chairs, and make sure they\u0026rsquo;ll work together. When choosing chairs, you\u0026rsquo;ll also want to consider what you plan on using the table for most: dining with family? Make sure you pick chairs with good back support: it\u0026rsquo;s hard to linger over dinner if your core is getting tired from staying balanced. If you plan to use the table primarily for drinks, tabling snacks, or displaying photos, a stool is a good, subtle option.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eConsider placement\u003cbr /\u003eDifferently shaped bar tables will serve different purposes in your home. A round bar table is best when you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a way to entertain friends and family without taking up a lot of square footage in your space. A round table doesn\u0026rsquo;t, however, does command the eye: if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for something to use as a snack table or a bar, move away from circular shapes. A square or rectangular bar table, on the other hand, is easy to tuck into a corner when you want it to quietly hold the Campari and nuts, or can move to the center of a room to host your friends for a round before you hit the bar.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe finisher\u003cbr /\u003eThe finish, that is. Choosing the right finish for your bar table will go a long way in determining the lifespan of your bar table. It also goes a long way towards complementing the look of your space. Looking to create an airy vibe? Light colors, thin legs, and/or glass-topped tables are a great way to add chic shapes without overtaking the space. Glass is easy to clean, whereas light materials like white marbles have their own set of specific care instructions. Heavier materials, such as wood and concrete, bring a moody contemplative vibe to a space. Concrete and dark-stained woods are relatively simple to care for, where wooden tops require a little more attention. To keep your wood-topped bar table looking as beautiful as the day you bought it, make sure you keep soft trivets on hand to avoid heat marks and scratches.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eA modern bar table is a great way to bring people together over a meal in your small space, or to set out a banger spread of nuts, cheese, spirits, and crudites.
