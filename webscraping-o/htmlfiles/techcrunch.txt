But not long ago, she was the one in need of a coach.<\/p>\n<p>But prior to that, Tao found herself in a new high-powered position at the mobile advertising company Tapjoy. Although she had plenty of sales experience, she was now working in an executive role leading the company&#8217;s entire sales staff. It was a tough learning curve. But the company&#8217;s board paired her with an executive coach, Lori Mazan, who ultimately helped Tao succeed.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That really had a profound impact, not just on my professional development, but my personal development as well,&#8221; Tao said.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tShow investors that you&#8217;re committed to following through. That makes all the difference.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Later on, Tao and Mazan teamed up to launch Sounding Board, a service with a proprietary algorithm that matches participants with coaches. Its capabilities-driven model can even measure the impact of the coaching.<\/p>\n<p>At the beginning, Tao didn&#8217;t have many resources. Ultimately, she raised $15 million in a pre-seed and Series A round. An impressive group of investors got in on the action, including<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/roybahat\"> Roy Bahat of Bloomberg Beta<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/precursorvc.com\/team_member\/charles-hudson\/\"> Charles Hudson of Precursor Ventures<\/a> and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.canaan.com\/team\/maha-ibrahim\"> Maha Ibrahim of Canaan<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>On<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.foundersuite.com\/how-i-raised-it-with-christine-tao-of-sounding-board\/\"> an episode of the \u201cHow I Raised It\u201d podcast<\/a>, Tao talked about raising money quickly, honing your strategy and getting back on your feet after all you hear is &#8220;no.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Start out scrappy<\/h2>\n<p>From the very beginning, Tao had big ideas.<\/p>\n<p>She wanted to make coaching accessible to all sorts of executive leaders. The service wouldn&#8217;t just be for correcting bad behavior, as coaching had been in the past, but about helping executives grow and develop so that they could lead their businesses with their best foot forward. Tao also aimed to make coaching available through remote technology.<\/p>\n<p>The problem was, Tao didn&#8217;t quite have the resources to get started. Initially, turning those ideas into a functioning business seemed about as realistic as climbing Mount Everest.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It took Christine Tao, founder of Sounding Board, just over three years to recognize the value of executive coaching and get her company to a Series A.

Super Heavy will undergo its own testing prior to flying with Starship, however, and a lot of that will be focused on assuring its fuel tanks can handle the pressurization and extreme temperatures required for keeping all that ignitable material stable prior to when the engines actually fire.<\/p>\n<p>Super Heavy uses the same engines as Starship \u2014 Raptor engines, to be specific, which SpaceX created new for this generation of launch vehicle. The final version will have a total of 28 Raptor engines, but this first prototype will likely be outfitted with far fewer, and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has confirmed that it&#8217;ll also remain grounded, as it&#8217;s intended to be used only for testing things like build and transportation mechanics.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yes, Booster 1 is a production pathfinder, figuring out how to build &amp; transport 70 meter tall stage.

available to us in just a few clicks or taps &#8212; but also how this ocean of available data can overwhelm and lap over a particular bit of intel the moment we need to lay our fingers back on it.<\/p>\n<p>Fire up a web browser and it&#8217;s hard to deny it&#8217;s the best of times for knowledge work. Yet working across multiple browser tabs and windows can feel like the friction-filled, frustrating worst.<\/p>\n<p>This is the problem <a href=\"https:\/\/www.meetsidekick.com\">Sidekick Browser<\/a> is taking aim at by adding a productivity-focused layer atop Chromium that it bills as a &#8220;work OS&#8221;.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Multiple tab hell? Sidekick&#8217;s answer is to let you work from inside apps that live in the browser, rather than scattered across multiple windows and tabs.<\/p>\n<p>Apps like Slack and Skype and WhatsApp can be pinned in the sidebar in a vertical stack where you can easily find and switch between them. It also has support for multiple logins, granular notification controls and the ability to search across all these third-party apps (it offers &#8220;hundreds&#8221; currently but says users can add custom adds &#8220;which would function just like a bookmark&#8221;) right from the browser.<\/p>\n<p>And for all those tabs you open up every time you go down an internet browsing rabbit hole, Sidekick offers a Sessions feature that lets you save them as a collective bundle for easy filing away &#8212; with ofc the ability to reopen and revisit again at a later click.<\/p>\n<p>The built-in search also spans these Sessions so there&#8217;s no need to manually scroll back through the browser&#8217;s search history to try to track down where exactly it was you saw that reference to that randomly relevant bit of intel you breezed across one online day.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2RnIl81BiG\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/03\/browsers-are-interesting-again\/\">Browsers are interesting again<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute;

is Sidekick&#8217;s alternative fix.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also tackling productivity on the technical side &#8212; taking aim at browser-based lag with an &#8220;AI based tab suspension&#8221; feature that&#8217;s designed to improve on how Google&#8217;s Chrome browser hogs RAM by predicting which tabs the user is not going to use and dumping them from memory.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Sidekick is the fastest browser built especially for work,&#8221; is its elevator-pitchy promise.<\/p>\n<p>Collaboration is another core focus with features intended to help knowledge working teams be more productive as a unit; offering stuff like team role provisioning and custom workspaces to support different Session, app Sidebar and tabs set-ups, such as for a project or client.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also remote configuration tools for device security; a baked-in password manager for collaborative convenience to support teams needing to share passwords; and an embedded video chat platform so you can do team chats right from the exact same browser-based workspace you&#8217;re all using.<\/p>\n<p>Sidekick comes with its own ad blocker and anti-fingerprinting tech too &#8212; for a stated privacy purpose but also for an extra speed bump (i.e. via better page load times).<\/p>\n<p>Also on privacy, the startup&#8217;s very public promise is &#8220;we&#8217;ll never sell your data&#8221; (and it further specifies this includes &#8220;searches, browsing history, or any personal information&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>The business model is SaaS and B2C for now, but Sidekick has designs on B2B &#8212; touting a pipeline of business-friendly features coming down the line.<\/p>\n<p>And &#8212; yes, before you ask &#8212; Chrome extensions are supported.<\/p>\n<p>Sidekick is announcing $2 million in seed funding led by KPCB &#8212; along with Remote First Capital and other angel investors.<\/p>\n<p>Founder Dmitry Pushkarev has played and won at the startup game before, in some very different areas &#8212; having founded a DNA sequencing company (Moleculo) back in 2011, which was quickly acquired by Illumina.<\/p>\n<p>Then in 2013 he left to found another business, ClusterK &#8212; focused on optimizing cloud computing resources across multiple cloud providers &#8212; which was acquired by Amazon in 2016, where Pushkarev stayed for a couple of years before getting the founder itch again.<\/p>\n<p>A stint as entrepreneur in residence (EIR) at Kleiner Perkins investigating the future of work was where the germ of the idea for Sidekick was born.<\/p>\n<p>The tool grabbed some early eyeballs a few months ago <a href=\"https:\/\/www.producthunt.com\/posts\/sidekick-browser\">via Product Hunt<\/a> &#8212; where Chris Messina was among its early fans, lauding the team for shaking up the browser space by combining &#8220;so many components that are essential to finding productivity as a modern knowledge worker!&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Though Pushkarev was careful to course-correct Messina that it&#8217;s not building a full-fat browser to challenge Chrome itself (or any other internet browser).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We do not intend to compete with browsers, they are a great choice for browsing,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Our goal is improve the browsing experience for work and productivity &#8212; something that, regretfully, browsers cannot do.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The San Francisco-based startup says it&#8217;s now being used by teams at companies including Microsoft, Dropbox, Slack and Lyft. It has around 30,000 users at this point a few months after its November 2020 launch, per Pushkarev, who says the team is mostly focused on product (&#8220;activation, retention, virality&#8221;) at this early stage.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The typical user is a knowledge worker &#8212; product managers, engineers, marketers, a fair number of students. Basically, prosumers who don&#8217;t just browse online, but do productive work and utilize communication tools,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;During my EIR at KPCB, we thought a lot about the future of work, and one striking aspect of it is that today knowledge workers spend most of their time working in Browsers &#8212; a tool designed for Browsing,&#8221; he goes on, explaining the genesis of the idea for Sidekick.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There are some important differences between how we browse and how we work, in particular &#8212; knowledge workers, spend more time working in web applications, with documents, using communications tools, accessing multiple accounts, and having to navigate a vast array of documents and projects. Unlike browsing &#8212; which is mostly search-based consumption of information.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Clearly, these are very different use cases, but companies who make browsers today have no ability to invest in making browser better for work due to their business model &#8212; they are paid by Google or Microsoft for searches, and any complication of the UX would mean that millions of users would turn to simpler browsers and they will lose search revenue.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We thought that it&#8217;s an unprecedented situation, where 200M professionals don\u2019t have access to professional tools, and that the industry is so heavily disincentivized to build those. As a result, we decided to change this and invent a new category of software &#8212; Browser for Work, or how we call it internally &#8212; a Work OS.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So what type of work\/worker is Sidekick made for?\u00a0&#8220;Online work with Web applications, lots of documents, communication apps, multiple accounts, and different work streams. It&#8217;s designer for prosumers and wouldn&#8217;t be the best choice for just browsing &#8212; something that would be better served by other browsers,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>While the laser focus is work and productivity, Sidekick users can create multiple environments within the software &#8212; so could make other spaces more geared toward chilling out\/downtime, or other purposes than work too, for use at other times.<\/p>\n<p>While browsers do offer a variety of features like shortcuts and other elements aimed at increasing convenience, Pushkarev argues they simple can&#8217;t go as far as Sidekick intends to in honing a great work environment because their business model is too focused on search ads (in the case of Google Chrome) &#8212; or just because they need to be a more generalist tool for web browsing. Sidekick is therefore very much a &#8220;standalone business,&#8221; not just a nice set of enhancements any existing browser could make, in his view.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, extending other browsers is not a viable path here, one has to go deep inside Chrome codebase and re-think performance, memory optimization, security, support for multiple accounts, and privacy to build a comprehensive solution,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>One example of going above and beyond what a browser could or would do itself is the support it&#8217;s built for &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of third-party apps. &#8220;The reason we built this support is for better integrations &#8212; being able to display and control badges and notifications, integrate with our search, support multiple accounts and add helpful extensions,&#8221; he explains.<\/p>\n<p>He also points to the New Tab Page (shown in the feature image at the top of this post), which is due to launch for all users by the end of the month and which displays &#8220;all documents that work with organized according to type, with human-readable titles, and instant search across it&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Without deep integration with these apps we wouldn\u2019t be able to provide this experience and display barely usable browser history instead,&#8221; he notes.<\/p>\n<p>On the business model front, Pushkarev is confident that SaaS can work &#8212; and that Sidekick doesn&#8217;t have to monetize like other browsers do (i.e. &#8220;through data and searches&#8221;) &#8212; arguing:\u00a0&#8220;We are making a tool that saves hours to potentially millions of knowledge workers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Another piece of the story is our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.meetsidekick.com\/how-it-works\">B2B business<\/a>, which we are building as we speak, but it&#8217;s still in early beta. In B2B, product browsers become a sort of company-provisioned remote workstations, that can be remotely configured and secured according to a role,&#8221; he adds.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is where the majority of our revenue comes from at the moment, but we are launching our first attempts at B2C monetization in March, by offering a subscription.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"bpfvaMX1wR\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/02\/everyone-has-an-opinion-on-the-27-7b-slack-acquisition\/\">Everyone has an opinion on the $27.7B Slack acquisition<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Everyone has an opinion on the $27.7B Slack acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/02\/everyone-has-an-opinion-on-the-27-7b-slack-acquisition\/embed\/#?secret=bpfvaMX1wR\" data-secret=\"bpfvaMX1wR\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Kp5SqYY8HT\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/29\/kpcb-has-already-blown-through-much-of-the-600-million-it-raised-last-year\/\">Kleiner Perkins has already blown through much of the $600 million it raised last year<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Kleiner Perkins has already blown through much of the $600 million it raised last year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/29\/kpcb-has-already-blown-through-much-of-the-600-million-it-raised-last-year\/embed\/#?secret=Kp5SqYY8HT\" data-secret=\"Kp5SqYY8HT\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The paradox of connected computing is how much information is made available to us in just a few clicks or taps &#8212; but also how this ocean of available data can overwhelm and lap over a particular bit of intel the moment we need to lay our fingers back on it.

That, of course, would mark an interesting alternative from Google\u2019s chosen wearOS.<\/p>\n<p>This week, the company highlighted <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2021\/03\/inside-facebook-reality-labs-wrist-based-interaction-for-the-next-computing-platform\/\">another wrist-based wearable<\/a>. The specifics of the project don\u2019t line up super closely with earlier reports, which could well mean two separate projects. Facebook is a big company, after all.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTechAtFacebook%2Fvideos%2F1126949421469231%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>This particular project out of Facebook Reality Labs is more focused on providing an alternative computer interface. Specifically, it seems in line with the company\u2019s augmented reality efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Per yesterday\u2019s blog post:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A separate device you could store in your pocket like a phone or a game controller adds a layer of friction between you and your environment. As we explored the possibilities, placing an input device at the wrist became the clear answer. The wrist is a traditional place to wear a watch, meaning it could reasonably fit into everyday life and social contexts. It\u2019s a comfortable location for all-day wear. It\u2019s located right next to the primary instruments you use to interact with the world \u2014 your hands. This proximity would allow us to bring the rich control capabilities of your hands into AR, enabling intuitive, powerful and satisfying interaction.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I will say that, based on the information presented, this seems more conceptual. As in, this could be the key to offering more seamless control for some future augmented reality system. And even still, it\u2019s presented as a step on the way to a more deeply integrated human-computer solution. How deeply you want Facebook to integrate with your neurons is apparently a question we\u2019re all going to have to ask ourselves in the not too distant future.<\/p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTechAtFacebook%2Fvideos%2F1146186389155473%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>This interface specifically is designed to use electromyography (EMG) sensors to interpret motor nerve signals and interact with the interface accordingly. The subject interestingly came up <a href=\"https:\/\/constine.substack.com\/p\/pressclub-with-mark-zuckerberg-daniel\">during a Clubhouse event<\/a> featuring Mark Zuckerberg last night. After Pebble founder\/YC partner Eric Migicovsky discussed experiences dealing with Apple for his own smartwatch startup, the Facebook CEO said the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>If you&#8217;re trying to build a watch, which we&#8217;re exploring as we talked about the wrist thing and I don&#8217;t want to call it a watch, but it&#8217;s the basic neural interfaces work that our Facebook reality labs team demoed some of our research about today. With the neural interface on the wrist, if you want that to integrate with the phone in any way, it&#8217;s just so much easier on Android than iOS. My guess is that this is an area where there probably should be a lot more focus. And I do think the private APIs are just something that makes it really difficult to have a healthy ecosystem.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cExploring\u201d seems like an operative word here. But it\u2019s always cool\/fascinating to see these projects in their early stages. Even if the promises might still seem a tad\u2026overzealous.<\/p>\n<p>EMG will eventually progress to richer controls. In AR, you\u2019ll be able to actually touch and move virtual UIs and objects, as you can see in this demo video. You\u2019ll also be able to control virtual objects at a distance. It\u2019s sort of like having a superpower like the Force.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"aWZcUonNsO\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/12\/will-apple-facebook-or-microsoft-be-the-future-of-augmented-reality\/\">Will Apple, Facebook or Microsoft be the future of augmented reality?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Will Apple, Facebook or Microsoft be the future of augmented reality?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/12\/will-apple-facebook-or-microsoft-be-the-future-of-augmented-reality\/embed\/#?secret=aWZcUonNsO\" data-secret=\"aWZcUonNsO\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"IiUrheTwBZ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/19\/week-in-review-facebook-hardware-finds-pandemic-market-fit\/\">Week in Review: Facebook hardware finds pandemic market fit<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Week in Review: Facebook hardware finds pandemic market fit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/19\/week-in-review-facebook-hardware-finds-pandemic-market-fit\/embed\/#?secret=IiUrheTwBZ\" data-secret=\"IiUrheTwBZ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook\u2019s hardware strategy often looks pretty opaque from the outside.

He added Blockstream is exploring solar-powered bitcoin mining options as a sort of \u201cretirement home\u201d for outdated machines.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWith solar energy, if you\u2019re only online 50% of the time, that\u2019s something to consider in terms of the cost analysis,\u201d Back said. \u201cThat\u2019s a better option for older machines, after you\u2019ve already recouped the costs of the equipment.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to surging cryptocurrency prices, there\u2019s now a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-crypto-currency-china-mining\/global-chip-shortage-hits-chinas-bitcoin-mining-sector-idUSKBN29R1AY\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">global shortage<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of bitcoin mining equipment, Back added, with demand outpacing supply and production taking up to six months per machine. Emma Todd, founder of the consultancy MMH Blockchain Group, said the shortage is driving up the price of mining machines.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFor example, a Bitmain Antminer S9 mining machine that used to cost $35 &#8211; $55 in July 2020 on the secondary market, now costs about $275 &#8211; $300,\u201d Todd said. \u201cThis means that most, if not all mining companies looking to purchase new or secondary equipment, are all experiencing the same challenges. As a result of the global chip shortage, most new mining equipment that is scheduled to come out in the next few months, will almost certainly be delayed.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"DBgA0mJSH3\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/24\/how-emerging-markets-are-approaching-crypto\/\">How emerging markets are approaching crypto<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;How emerging markets are approaching crypto&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/24\/how-emerging-markets-are-approaching-crypto\/embed\/#?secret=DBgA0mJSH3\" data-secret=\"DBgA0mJSH3\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Critics like de Vries point out that, due to market forces, industrial miners are unlikely to reduce their power consumption with new machines, which are more efficient.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf you have more efficient machines but earn the same money, then people just run two machines instead of one,\u201d de Vries said.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And yet, because cryptocurrency prices are rising faster than new miners can be constructed, Back said \u201cretiring\u201d old machines with renewable energy sources becomes more profitable than simply abandoning them for new equipment.

It\u2019s broadly based on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/the-exchange\/\">the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch<\/a>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Want it in your inbox every Saturday morning? Sign up\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/newsletters\">here<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Earnings season is coming to a close, with public tech companies wrapping up their Q4 and 2020 disclosures. We don\u2019t care too much about the bigger players\u2019 results here at TechCrunch, but smaller tech companies we knew when they were wee startups can provide startup-related data points worth digesting. So, each quarter The Exchange spends time chatting with a host of CEOs and CFOs, trying to figure what\u2019s going on so that we can relay the information to private companies.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes it\u2019s useful, as our chat with <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/05\/inside-fintech-startup-upstarts-ipo-filing\/\">recent fintech IPO Upstart<\/a> proved after we got <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/19\/ai-fintech-products-are-operating-at-scale-and-investor-interest-is-maturing\/\">to noodle with the company<\/a> about rising acceptance of AI in the conservative banking industry.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>This week we caught up with Yext CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/howard\">Howard Lerman<\/a> and Smartsheet CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/markmader\">Mark Mader<\/a>. Yext builds data products for small businesses, and is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mediapost.com\/publications\/article\/361531\/how-yext-moves-website-search-closer-to-a-google-l.html\">betting its future on search products<\/a>. Smartsheet is a software company that works in the collaboration, no-code and future-of-work spaces.<\/p>\n<p>They are pretty different companies, really. But what they did share this time &#8217;round the earnings cycle were macro notes, or details regarding their forward financial guidance and what economic conditions they anticipate. As a macro-nerd, it piqued my interest.<\/p>\n<p>Yext cited a number of macroeconomic headwinds when it reported its Q4 results. And tying its future results somewhat to an uncertain macro picture, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/earnings\/call-transcripts\/2021\/03\/03\/yext-inc-yext-q4-2021-earnings-call-transcript\/\">said that it is<\/a> \u201cbasing [its] guidance on the business conditions [it sees for itself] and [its] customers currently, with the macro economy, which remains sluggish, and customers who remain cautious,\u201d per a transcript.<\/p>\n<p>Lerman told The Exchange that it was not clear when the world would open &#8212; something that matters for Yext\u2019s location-focused products &#8212; so the company was guiding for the year as if nothing would change. Wall Street didn\u2019t love it, but if the economy improves Yext won\u2019t have high hurdles to jump over. This is one tack that a company can take when it talks guidance.<\/p>\n<p>Smartsheet took a slightly different approach, saying in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/earnings\/call-transcripts\/2021\/03\/16\/smartsheet-inc-smar-q4-2021-earnings-call-transcri\/\">its earnings call<\/a> that its \u201cfiscal year &#8217;22 guidance contemplates a gradual improvement in the macro environment in the second half of the year.\u201d Mader said in an interview that his company wasn\u2019t hiring economists, but was instead simply listening to what others were saying.<\/p>\n<p>He also said that the macro climate matters more in saturated markets, which he doesn\u2019t think that Smartsheet is in; so, its results should be more impacted by things more like \u201cthe secular shift to the cloud and digital transformation,\u201d to quote its earnings call.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"KkH7W7LI1B\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/19\/ai-fintech-products-are-operating-at-scale-and-investor-interest-is-maturing\/\">AI fintech products are operating at scale and investor interest is maturing<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;AI fintech products are operating at scale and investor interest is maturing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/19\/ai-fintech-products-are-operating-at-scale-and-investor-interest-is-maturing\/embed\/#?secret=KkH7W7LI1B\" data-secret=\"KkH7W7LI1B\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>What the economy will do this year matters quite a lot for startups. An improving economy could boost interest rates, making money a bit more expensive and bonds more attractive. Valuations could see modest downward pressure in that case. And venture capital could slow fractionally. But with Yext forecasting as if it was facing a flat road and Smartsheet only expecting things to pick up pace from Q3 on, it\u2019s likely that what we have now is mostly what we\u2019ll get.<\/p>\n<p>And things are pretty damn good for startups and late-stage liquidity at the moment. So, smooth sailing ahead for startup-land? At least as far as our current perspective can discern.<\/p>\n<p>We still have a grip of notes from Splunk CEO Douglas Merritt on how to take an old-school software company and turn it into a cloud-first company, and Jamf CEO Dean Hager about packaging discrete software products. More to come from them in fits.<\/p>\n<h2>Various and sundry<\/h2>\n<p>There were rounds big and small this week. Companies like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/16\/squarespace-raises-300m-at-staggering-10b-valuation\/\">Squarespace raised $300 million<\/a>, while Airtable <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/15\/airtable-is-now-valued-at-5-77b-with-a-fresh-270-million-in-series-e-funding\/\">raised $277 million<\/a>. On the smaller-end of the spectrum, my favorite round of the week was a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/17\/gpt-3-powered-copy-ai-raises-2-9m-in-a-round-led-by-craft-ventures\/\">modest $2.9 million raise from Copy.ai<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But there were other rounds that TechCrunch didn\u2019t get to that are still worth our time. So, here are a few more for you to dig into this weekend:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">A so-called pre-Series A round for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intelligentlilli.com\/\">Lilli<\/a>, a U.K.-based startup that uses sensors and other tech to track the well-being of folks who might need help to live on their own. Using tech to take care of folks is always good by me. The deal was worth \u00a34.5 million, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uktech.news\/news\/uk-saas-company-lilli-funding-20210318\">per UKTN<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">An IPO for Tuya, a Chinese software company that <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/china-tuya-poised-raise-915-012627944.html\">raised $915 million in its American debut<\/a>. Chinese IPOs on American indices were once a big deal. They are less frequent now. Surprised that I missed this one, but, hey, there\u2019s been a lot going on.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">And the Republic round, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20210317005272\/en\/Republic-Announces-36M-Series-A-to-Democratize-Access-to-Investing-for-Everyone\">worth $36 million<\/a>, that is banking on the recently-expanded American crowdfunding regulations.

href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/15\/julia-collins-and-sarah-kunst-outline-how-to-build-a-fundraising-process\/\">Extra Crunch Live<\/a> this past week, Cleo Capital founding partner Sarah Kunst broke down what founders can learn from Supreme, a sought-after streetwear brand. She argued that founders, similar to Supreme, should build a brand around themselves that is so well-respected and has clout that whenever they start something new, investors will line up.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA Supreme shirt that costs $100 bucks in the store will cost $1,000 online so, as an investor, I am just a kid on the street corner flipping sportswear,\u201d Kunst mentioned. &#8220;Who do I think is going to be an investment with such velocity that getting in early is going to be more than worth it as they grow.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I think this is the best framing I\u2019ve seen about how to drum up excitement for a startup as a founder. FOMO isn\u2019t a strategy, it\u2019s a tactic. What really works, as Kunst alluded to, is when founders can point to key insights they\u2019ve had throughout their career beyond the context of a fundraising process. In other words, anyone can create a nice t-shirt and slap a logo on it. Which founder in this sector is going to give it meaning?

This week, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/18\/fleksy-co-founder-is-suing-apple-over-lost-revenue-resulting-from-app-store-scammers\/\">Eleftheriou filed a lawsuit that attempts to hold Apple accountable<\/a> for his own app&#8217;s lost revenue, saying that Apple promises developers a safe and trustworthy marketplace, but then allows these scammers to operate to the detriment of legitimate apps like his own. Though some news articles positioned the case as some sort of antitrust lawsuit, it&#8217;s really more focused on scammers and the accountability Apple has for how its App Store operates, which apps are listed and how well it&#8217;s managed and policed. Eleftheriou is asking Apple to compensate him for his lost revenue and other damages as a result of Apple&#8217;s ill-run app marketplace, as well as what he claims are unfair App Review rejections.<\/p>\n<h3>Google Play drops commissions to 15% on some earnings<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2004747\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2004747\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2004747\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Google Play Store screen\" width=\"680\" height=\"438\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg 2400w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?resize=768,494 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?resize=680,438 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?resize=1536,989 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?resize=2048,1318 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/mika-baumeister-QIpLrHJiv2o-unsplash.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2004747\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Google Play Store screen<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Google has followed Apple&#8217;s lead in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/16\/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year\/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29\">reducing commissions for the Google Play store<\/a>.

Apple, by comparison, starts charging 30% once the developer tops $1 million. Google said 99% of developers who sell goods and services through the Play Store will see a 50% reduction in fees. According to App Annie data, very few Google Play developers make more than $1 million &#8212; in fact, only 2,035 developers do on Google Play, compared with 3,611 on iOS. To put this in perspective in terms of revenue, developers making up to $1 million in consumer spend only comprised 5% of total Google Play consumer spend in 2020, the firm noted.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"TSb1thekuH\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/16\/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year\/\">Google Play drops commissions to 15% from 30%, following Apple&#8217;s move last year<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Google Play drops commissions to 15% from 30%, following Apple&#8217;s move last year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/16\/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year\/embed\/#?secret=TSb1thekuH\" data-secret=\"TSb1thekuH\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h3>Apple&#8217;s ATT scores a win in France<\/h3>\n<p>Apple <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/17\/frances-competition-authority-declines-to-block-apples-opt-in-consent-for-ios-app-tracking\/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29\">fended off an attempt by advertisers in France<\/a> who wanted to derail the IDFA change in iOS, which will require users&#8217; permission in order to track them.

anyone to read them all, especially in the field of machine learning, which now affects (and produces papers in) practically every industry and company. This column aims to collect some of the most relevant recent discoveries and papers \u2014 particularly in but not limited to artificial intelligence \u2014 and explain why they matter.<\/p>\n<p>This week brings a few unusual applications of or developments in machine learning, as well as a particularly unusual rejection of the method for pandemic-related analysis.<\/p>\n<p>One hardly expects to find machine learning in the domain of government regulation, if only because one assumes federal regulators are hopelessly behind the times when it comes to this sort of thing. So it may surprise you that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has partnered with researchers at Stanford to<a href=\"https:\/\/news.stanford.edu\/2021\/03\/08\/assessing-regulatory-fairness-machine-learning\/\"> algorithmically root out violators of environmental rules<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>When you see the scope of the issue, it makes sense. EPA authorities need to process millions of permits and observations pertaining to Clean Water Act compliance, things such as self-reported amounts of pollutants from various industries and independent reports from labs and field teams. The Stanford-designed process sorted through these to isolate patterns like which types of plants, in which areas, were most likely to affect which demographics. For instance, wastewater treatment in urban peripheries may tend to underreport pollution and put communities of color at risk.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Pj4xD71NMX8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p>The very process of reducing the compliance question to something that can be computationally parsed and compared helped clarify the agency&#8217;s priorities, showing that while the technique could identify more permit holders with small violations, it may draw attention away from general permit types that act as a fig leaf for multiple large violators.<\/p>\n<p>Another large source of waste and expense is processing scrap metal. Tons of it goes through sorting and recycling centers, where the work is still mostly done by humans, and as you might imagine, it&#8217;s a dangerous and dull job. <a href=\"https:\/\/earthryse.prowly.com\/130625-eversteel-ai-based-image-recognition-technology-for-sorting-steel-scraps\">Eversteel is a startup out of the University of Tokyo<\/a> that aims to automate the process so that a large proportion of the work can be done before human workers even step in.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2126624\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/impurity_detection.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2126624\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2126624\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/impurity_detection.jpg\" alt=\"Image of scrap metal with AI-detected labels for various kinds of items overlaid.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/impurity_detection.jpg 2170w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/impurity_detection.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/impurity_detection.jpg?resize=300,150 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/impurity_detection.jpg?resize=768,384 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/impurity_detection.jpg?resize=680,340 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/impurity_detection.jpg?resize=1536,767 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/impurity_detection.jpg?resize=2048,1023 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/impurity_detection.jpg?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2126624\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Eversteel<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Eversteel uses a computer vision system to classify incoming scrap into nearly two dozen categories, and to flag impure (i.e., an unrecyclable alloy) or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Yg-PDmfuha4\">anomalous items<\/a> for removal. It&#8217;s still at an early stage, but the industry isn&#8217;t going anywhere, and the lack of any large data set for training their models (they had to make their own, informed by steelworkers and imagery) showed Eversteel that this was indeed virgin territory for AI. With luck, they&#8217;ll be able to commercialize their system and attract the funding they need to break into this large but tech-starved industry.<\/p>\n<p>Another unusual but potentially helpful application of computer vision is in soil monitoring, a task every farmer has to do regularly to monitor water and nutrient levels. When they do manage to automate it, it&#8217;s done in a rather heavy-handed way. A team from the University of South Australia and Middle Technical University in Baghdad show that the sensors, hardware and thermal cameras used now may be overkill.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2126556\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/soil-cv.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2126556\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2126556\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/soil-cv.jpg\" alt=\"Buckets of soil shown under various lights.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/soil-cv.jpg 2370w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/soil-cv.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/soil-cv.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/soil-cv.jpg?resize=768,507 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/soil-cv.jpg?resize=680,449 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/soil-cv.jpg?resize=1536,1014 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/soil-cv.jpg?resize=2048,1352 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/soil-cv.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2126556\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> UNISA\/Middle Technical University<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Surprisingly, their answer is a standard RGB digital camera, which analyzes the color of the soil to estimate moisture. &#8220;We tested it at different distances, times and illumination levels, and the system was very accurate,&#8221; said Ali Al-Naji, one of the creators.

approved in LA, Abodu&#8217;s backyard homes can now go from contract to completion in as little as 30 days"},"content":{"rendered":"<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.abodu.com\/\">Abodu<\/a>, one of a slew of startup companies pitching backyard homes and office spaces to Californians in an effort to help address the state&#8217;s housing shortage, has instituted a new &#8220;Quickship&#8221; program that can take an order from contract to construction and installation in about thirty days.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Behind the quick turnaround time is a pre-approval process that was first rolled out in San Jose, Calif. and came to Los Angeles in recent weeks.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Abodu began installing homes through a pre-approval process back in 2019, when the city of San Jose created a program that allowed developers of alternative dwelling units to submit plans for pre-approval to cut the time for homeowners.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That approval process means that ADU developers like Abodu can be permitted in one hour. Other ADU developers pre-approved in San Jose, Calif. include <a href=\"https:\/\/actonadu.com\/\">Acton ADU<\/a>, the venture backed <a href=\"https:\/\/connect-homes.com\/\">Connect Homes<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getadu.com\/\">J. Kretschmer Architect<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mayberryworkshop.com\/adu\">Mayberry Workshop<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.openremodel.com\/\">Open Remodel<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prefabadu.com\/\">prefabADU<\/a>. In Los Angeles, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mas.la\/project-selection-new\">La Mas<\/a>, IT House, Design, Bitches, Connect Homes, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.welcomeprojects.com\/\">Welcome Projects<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/firstoff.net\/projects\/LA_ADU\/\">First Office<\/a> have all had homes pre-approved for construction.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beyond the cities where Abodu&#8217;s ADUs have received pre-approval, the company has built across California in cities ranging from, Palo Alto, Millbrae, Orange County, to LA and Oakland. Units in the Bay Area cost roughly $189,000 as a starting price, compared to the $650,000 to $850,000 it takes to build units in a mid-rise apartment building, or $1 million per unit in a steel-reinforced highrise, according to the company.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cOur Quickship program is the fastest way to add housing,\u201d said John Geary, CEO at Abodu.\u00a0 \u201cHomeowners with immediate needs, be it family situations or those looking for investment income, can now complete an ADU project in as little as four weeks. A key mission for Abodu is to make a serious dent in our state\u2019s housing deficit while providing people and municipalities the necessary blueprint to enact real change. \u201d<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For Initialized partner (and former TechCrunch writer) Kim-Mai Cutler, who serves on the Abodu board of directors, the achievement of a 30 day construction milestone is almost a dream come true. Cutler <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2014\/04\/14\/sf-housing\/\">wrote the book (or the equivalent of a book)<\/a> on the housing crisis and its impact on the Bay Area and California broadly.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">That piece led Cutler to work in public service &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on boards and commissions <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hsh.sfgov.org\/committees\/lhcb\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">overseeing the spending of federal dollars on homelessness<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cityofberkeley.info\/Clerk\/Commissions\/Commissions__Measure_O_Bond_Oversight_Committee.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the proceeds of municipal bonds directed at financing affordable housing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">because yes, for some segments of residents, you do have to explicitly subsidize housing at the local level.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">),&#8221; as she noted in a blog post about her investment in\u00a0<\/span>Abodu.<\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><div id=\"attachment_2062908\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2062908\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2062908\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/DSF1364.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/DSF1364.jpg 3600w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/DSF1364.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/DSF1364.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/DSF1364.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/DSF1364.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/DSF1364.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/DSF1364.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/DSF1364.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2062908\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The interior of an Abodu home.

Its incredibly low cost will enable a lot of opportunities to develop new inventory and the simple fact is that inventory remains a scarce commodity.

Unfortunately, many are dissatisfied with their current tools due to the loss of productivity, multiple \u201csources of truth,\u201d and the lack of integration with their current tools and systems.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tA gap exists between the functionalities provided by current BI and data discovery tools and what users want and need.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Throughout my career, I\u2019ve spoken with many executives who wonder why BI continues to fail them, especially when data discovery tools like Qlik and Tableau have gained such momentum. The reality is, these tools are great for a very limited set of use cases among a limited audience of users \u2014 and the adoption rates reflect that reality.<\/p>\n<p>Data discovery applications allow analysts to link with data sources and perform self-service analysis, but still come with major pitfalls. Lack of self-service customization, the inability to integrate into workflows with other applications, and an overall lack of flexibility seriously impacts the ability for most users (who aren\u2019t data analysts) to derive meaningful information from these tools.<\/p>\n<p>BI platforms and data discovery applications are supposed to launch insight into action, informing decisions at every level of the organization. But many are instead left with costly investments that actually create inefficiencies, hinder workflows and exclude the vast majority of employees who could benefit from those operational insights. Now that\u2019s what I like to call a lack of ROI.<\/p>\n<p>Business leaders across a variety of industries \u2014 including \u201clegacy\u201d sectors like manufacturing, healthcare and financial services \u2014 are demanding better and, in my opinion, they should have gotten it long ago.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s time to abandon BI \u2014 at least as we currently know it.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned over the years about why traditional BI platforms and newer tools like data discovery applications fail and what I\u2019ve gathered from companies that moved away from them.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>The inefficiency breakdown is killing your company<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Traditional BI platforms and data discovery applications require users to exit their workflow to attempt data collection. And, as you can guess, stalling teams in the middle of their workflow creates massive inefficiencies.

The company has done fairly well with Oculus sales amid pandemic demand. Even its Echo Show competitor Portal has seen a bump as people have been forced to socially distance. The company\u2019s smartphone partnership with HTC, meanwhile, fell flat eight or so years back.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/facebook-plans-smartwatch-with-focus-on-messaging-health\">reports surfaced<\/a> that the company was working on its own Apple Watch competitor. The smartwatch was said to have a health focus, running on an open-source version of Android. That, of course, would mark an interesting alternative from Google\u2019s chosen wearOS.<\/p>\n<p>This week, the company highlighted <a href=\"https:\/\/about.fb.com\/news\/2021\/03\/inside-facebook-reality-labs-wrist-based-interaction-for-the-next-computing-platform\/\">another wrist-based wearable<\/a>. The specifics of the project don\u2019t line up super closely with earlier reports, which could well mean two separate projects. Facebook is a big company, after all.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTechAtFacebook%2Fvideos%2F1126949421469231%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>This particular project out of Facebook Reality Labs is more focused on providing an alternative computer interface. Specifically, it seems in line with the company\u2019s augmented reality efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Per yesterday\u2019s blog post:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>A separate device you could store in your pocket like a phone or a game controller adds a layer of friction between you and your environment. As we explored the possibilities, placing an input device at the wrist became the clear answer. The wrist is a traditional place to wear a watch, meaning it could reasonably fit into everyday life and social contexts. It\u2019s a comfortable location for all-day wear. It\u2019s located right next to the primary instruments you use to interact with the world \u2014 your hands. This proximity would allow us to bring the rich control capabilities of your hands into AR, enabling intuitive, powerful and satisfying interaction.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>I will say that, based on the information presented, this seems more conceptual. As in, this could be the key to offering more seamless control for some future augmented reality system. And even still, it\u2019s presented as a step on the way to a more deeply integrated human-computer solution. How deeply you want Facebook to integrate with your neurons is apparently a question we\u2019re all going to have to ask ourselves in the not too distant future.<\/p>\n<p><iframe style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTechAtFacebook%2Fvideos%2F1146186389155473%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>This interface specifically is designed to use electromyography (EMG) sensors to interpret motor nerve signals and interact with the interface accordingly. The subject interestingly came up <a href=\"https:\/\/constine.substack.com\/p\/pressclub-with-mark-zuckerberg-daniel\">during a Clubhouse event<\/a> featuring Mark Zuckerberg last night. After Pebble founder\/YC partner Eric Migicovsky discussed experiences dealing with Apple for his own smartwatch startup, the Facebook CEO said the following:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>If you&#8217;re trying to build a watch, which we&#8217;re exploring as we talked about the wrist thing and I don&#8217;t want to call it a watch, but it&#8217;s the basic neural interfaces work that our Facebook reality labs team demoed some of our research about today. With the neural interface on the wrist, if you want that to integrate with the phone in any way, it&#8217;s just so much easier on Android than iOS. My guess is that this is an area where there probably should be a lot more focus. And I do think the private APIs are just something that makes it really difficult to have a healthy ecosystem.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>\u201cExploring\u201d seems like an operative word here. But it\u2019s always cool\/fascinating to see these projects in their early stages. Even if the promises might still seem a tad\u2026overzealous.<\/p>\n<p>EMG will eventually progress to richer controls. In AR, you\u2019ll be able to actually touch and move virtual UIs and objects, as you can see in this demo video. You\u2019ll also be able to control virtual objects at a distance. It\u2019s sort of like having a superpower like the Force.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"aWZcUonNsO\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/12\/will-apple-facebook-or-microsoft-be-the-future-of-augmented-reality\/\">Will Apple, Facebook or Microsoft be the future of augmented reality?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Will Apple, Facebook or Microsoft be the future of augmented reality?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/12\/will-apple-facebook-or-microsoft-be-the-future-of-augmented-reality\/embed\/#?secret=aWZcUonNsO\" data-secret=\"aWZcUonNsO\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"IiUrheTwBZ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/19\/week-in-review-facebook-hardware-finds-pandemic-market-fit\/\">Week in Review: Facebook hardware finds pandemic market fit<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Week in Review: Facebook hardware finds pandemic market fit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/19\/week-in-review-facebook-hardware-finds-pandemic-market-fit\/embed\/#?secret=IiUrheTwBZ\" data-secret=\"IiUrheTwBZ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook\u2019s hardware strategy often looks pretty opaque from the outside.

available to us in just a few clicks or taps &#8212; but also how this ocean of available data can overwhelm and lap over a particular bit of intel the moment we need to lay our fingers back on it.<\/p>\n<p>Fire up a web browser and it&#8217;s hard to deny it&#8217;s the best of times for knowledge work. Yet working across multiple browser tabs and windows can feel like the friction-filled, frustrating worst.<\/p>\n<p>This is the problem <a href=\"https:\/\/www.meetsidekick.com\">Sidekick Browser<\/a> is taking aim at by adding a productivity-focused layer atop Chromium that it bills as a &#8220;work OS&#8221;.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Multiple tab hell? Sidekick&#8217;s answer is to let you work from inside apps that live in the browser, rather than scattered across multiple windows and tabs.<\/p>\n<p>Apps like Slack and Skype and WhatsApp can be pinned in the sidebar in a vertical stack where you can easily find and switch between them. It also has support for multiple logins, granular notification controls and the ability to search across all these third-party apps (it offers &#8220;hundreds&#8221; currently but says users can add custom adds &#8220;which would function just like a bookmark&#8221;) right from the browser.<\/p>\n<p>And for all those tabs you open up every time you go down an internet browsing rabbit hole, Sidekick offers a Sessions feature that lets you save them as a collective bundle for easy filing away &#8212; with ofc the ability to reopen and revisit again at a later click.<\/p>\n<p>The built-in search also spans these Sessions so there&#8217;s no need to manually scroll back through the browser&#8217;s search history to try to track down where exactly it was you saw that reference to that randomly relevant bit of intel you breezed across one online day.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"2RnIl81BiG\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/03\/browsers-are-interesting-again\/\">Browsers are interesting again<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute;

is Sidekick&#8217;s alternative fix.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also tackling productivity on the technical side &#8212; taking aim at browser-based lag with an &#8220;AI based tab suspension&#8221; feature that&#8217;s designed to improve on how Google&#8217;s Chrome browser hogs RAM by predicting which tabs the user is not going to use and dumping them from memory.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Sidekick is the fastest browser built especially for work,&#8221; is its elevator-pitchy promise.<\/p>\n<p>Collaboration is another core focus with features intended to help knowledge working teams be more productive as a unit; offering stuff like team role provisioning and custom workspaces to support different Session, app Sidebar and tabs set-ups, such as for a project or client.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also remote configuration tools for device security; a baked-in password manager for collaborative convenience to support teams needing to share passwords; and an embedded video chat platform so you can do team chats right from the exact same browser-based workspace you&#8217;re all using.<\/p>\n<p>Sidekick comes with its own ad blocker and anti-fingerprinting tech too &#8212; for a stated privacy purpose but also for an extra speed bump (i.e. via better page load times).<\/p>\n<p>Also on privacy, the startup&#8217;s very public promise is &#8220;we&#8217;ll never sell your data&#8221; (and it further specifies this includes &#8220;searches, browsing history, or any personal information&#8221;).<\/p>\n<p>The business model is SaaS and B2C for now, but Sidekick has designs on B2B &#8212; touting a pipeline of business-friendly features coming down the line.<\/p>\n<p>And &#8212; yes, before you ask &#8212; Chrome extensions are supported.<\/p>\n<p>Sidekick is announcing $2 million in seed funding led by KPCB &#8212; along with Remote First Capital and other angel investors.<\/p>\n<p>Founder Dmitry Pushkarev has played and won at the startup game before, in some very different areas &#8212; having founded a DNA sequencing company (Moleculo) back in 2011, which was quickly acquired by Illumina.<\/p>\n<p>Then in 2013 he left to found another business, ClusterK &#8212; focused on optimizing cloud computing resources across multiple cloud providers &#8212; which was acquired by Amazon in 2016, where Pushkarev stayed for a couple of years before getting the founder itch again.<\/p>\n<p>A stint as entrepreneur in residence (EIR) at Kleiner Perkins investigating the future of work was where the germ of the idea for Sidekick was born.<\/p>\n<p>The tool grabbed some early eyeballs a few months ago <a href=\"https:\/\/www.producthunt.com\/posts\/sidekick-browser\">via Product Hunt<\/a> &#8212; where Chris Messina was among its early fans, lauding the team for shaking up the browser space by combining &#8220;so many components that are essential to finding productivity as a modern knowledge worker!&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Though Pushkarev was careful to course-correct Messina that it&#8217;s not building a full-fat browser to challenge Chrome itself (or any other internet browser).<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We do not intend to compete with browsers, they are a great choice for browsing,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Our goal is improve the browsing experience for work and productivity &#8212; something that, regretfully, browsers cannot do.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The San Francisco-based startup says it&#8217;s now being used by teams at companies including Microsoft, Dropbox, Slack and Lyft. It has around 30,000 users at this point a few months after its November 2020 launch, per Pushkarev, who says the team is mostly focused on product (&#8220;activation, retention, virality&#8221;) at this early stage.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The typical user is a knowledge worker &#8212; product managers, engineers, marketers, a fair number of students. Basically, prosumers who don&#8217;t just browse online, but do productive work and utilize communication tools,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;During my EIR at KPCB, we thought a lot about the future of work, and one striking aspect of it is that today knowledge workers spend most of their time working in Browsers &#8212; a tool designed for Browsing,&#8221; he goes on, explaining the genesis of the idea for Sidekick.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There are some important differences between how we browse and how we work, in particular &#8212; knowledge workers, spend more time working in web applications, with documents, using communications tools, accessing multiple accounts, and having to navigate a vast array of documents and projects. Unlike browsing &#8212; which is mostly search-based consumption of information.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Clearly, these are very different use cases, but companies who make browsers today have no ability to invest in making browser better for work due to their business model &#8212; they are paid by Google or Microsoft for searches, and any complication of the UX would mean that millions of users would turn to simpler browsers and they will lose search revenue.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We thought that it&#8217;s an unprecedented situation, where 200M professionals don\u2019t have access to professional tools, and that the industry is so heavily disincentivized to build those. As a result, we decided to change this and invent a new category of software &#8212; Browser for Work, or how we call it internally &#8212; a Work OS.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>So what type of work\/worker is Sidekick made for?\u00a0&#8220;Online work with Web applications, lots of documents, communication apps, multiple accounts, and different work streams. It&#8217;s designer for prosumers and wouldn&#8217;t be the best choice for just browsing &#8212; something that would be better served by other browsers,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>While the laser focus is work and productivity, Sidekick users can create multiple environments within the software &#8212; so could make other spaces more geared toward chilling out\/downtime, or other purposes than work too, for use at other times.<\/p>\n<p>While browsers do offer a variety of features like shortcuts and other elements aimed at increasing convenience, Pushkarev argues they simple can&#8217;t go as far as Sidekick intends to in honing a great work environment because their business model is too focused on search ads (in the case of Google Chrome) &#8212; or just because they need to be a more generalist tool for web browsing. Sidekick is therefore very much a &#8220;standalone business,&#8221; not just a nice set of enhancements any existing browser could make, in his view.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, extending other browsers is not a viable path here, one has to go deep inside Chrome codebase and re-think performance, memory optimization, security, support for multiple accounts, and privacy to build a comprehensive solution,&#8221; he says.<\/p>\n<p>One example of going above and beyond what a browser could or would do itself is the support it&#8217;s built for &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of third-party apps. &#8220;The reason we built this support is for better integrations &#8212; being able to display and control badges and notifications, integrate with our search, support multiple accounts and add helpful extensions,&#8221; he explains.<\/p>\n<p>He also points to the New Tab Page (shown in the feature image at the top of this post), which is due to launch for all users by the end of the month and which displays &#8220;all documents that work with organized according to type, with human-readable titles, and instant search across it&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Without deep integration with these apps we wouldn\u2019t be able to provide this experience and display barely usable browser history instead,&#8221; he notes.<\/p>\n<p>On the business model front, Pushkarev is confident that SaaS can work &#8212; and that Sidekick doesn&#8217;t have to monetize like other browsers do (i.e. &#8220;through data and searches&#8221;) &#8212; arguing:\u00a0&#8220;We are making a tool that saves hours to potentially millions of knowledge workers.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Another piece of the story is our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.meetsidekick.com\/how-it-works\">B2B business<\/a>, which we are building as we speak, but it&#8217;s still in early beta. In B2B, product browsers become a sort of company-provisioned remote workstations, that can be remotely configured and secured according to a role,&#8221; he adds.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is where the majority of our revenue comes from at the moment, but we are launching our first attempts at B2C monetization in March, by offering a subscription.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"bpfvaMX1wR\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/02\/everyone-has-an-opinion-on-the-27-7b-slack-acquisition\/\">Everyone has an opinion on the $27.7B Slack acquisition<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Everyone has an opinion on the $27.7B Slack acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/02\/everyone-has-an-opinion-on-the-27-7b-slack-acquisition\/embed\/#?secret=bpfvaMX1wR\" data-secret=\"bpfvaMX1wR\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Kp5SqYY8HT\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/29\/kpcb-has-already-blown-through-much-of-the-600-million-it-raised-last-year\/\">Kleiner Perkins has already blown through much of the $600 million it raised last year<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Kleiner Perkins has already blown through much of the $600 million it raised last year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/29\/kpcb-has-already-blown-through-much-of-the-600-million-it-raised-last-year\/embed\/#?secret=Kp5SqYY8HT\" data-secret=\"Kp5SqYY8HT\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The paradox of connected computing is how much information is made available to us in just a few clicks or taps &#8212; but also how this ocean of available data can overwhelm and lap over a particular bit of intel the moment we need to lay our fingers back on it.

But not long ago, she was the one in need of a coach.<\/p>\n<p>But prior to that, Tao found herself in a new high-powered position at the mobile advertising company Tapjoy. Although she had plenty of sales experience, she was now working in an executive role leading the company&#8217;s entire sales staff. It was a tough learning curve. But the company&#8217;s board paired her with an executive coach, Lori Mazan, who ultimately helped Tao succeed.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;That really had a profound impact, not just on my professional development, but my personal development as well,&#8221; Tao said.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tShow investors that you&#8217;re committed to following through. That makes all the difference.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>Later on, Tao and Mazan teamed up to launch Sounding Board, a service with a proprietary algorithm that matches participants with coaches. Its capabilities-driven model can even measure the impact of the coaching.<\/p>\n<p>At the beginning, Tao didn&#8217;t have many resources. Ultimately, she raised $15 million in a pre-seed and Series A round. An impressive group of investors got in on the action, including<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/roybahat\"> Roy Bahat of Bloomberg Beta<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/precursorvc.com\/team_member\/charles-hudson\/\"> Charles Hudson of Precursor Ventures<\/a> and<a href=\"https:\/\/www.canaan.com\/team\/maha-ibrahim\"> Maha Ibrahim of Canaan<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>On<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.foundersuite.com\/how-i-raised-it-with-christine-tao-of-sounding-board\/\"> an episode of the \u201cHow I Raised It\u201d podcast<\/a>, Tao talked about raising money quickly, honing your strategy and getting back on your feet after all you hear is &#8220;no.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Start out scrappy<\/h2>\n<p>From the very beginning, Tao had big ideas.<\/p>\n<p>She wanted to make coaching accessible to all sorts of executive leaders. The service wouldn&#8217;t just be for correcting bad behavior, as coaching had been in the past, but about helping executives grow and develop so that they could lead their businesses with their best foot forward. Tao also aimed to make coaching available through remote technology.<\/p>\n<p>The problem was, Tao didn&#8217;t quite have the resources to get started. Initially, turning those ideas into a functioning business seemed about as realistic as climbing Mount Everest.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It took Christine Tao, founder of Sounding Board, just over three years to recognize the value of executive coaching and get her company to a Series A.

with self-diagnostic software, is upgrading its product as it prepares for a major expansion into 10 new cities within the next two weeks.<\/p>\n<p>Superpedestrian is considered an up-and-coming player in the micromobility world because of how it handles safety issues. The company has developed AI \u2014 which is integrated into the vehicle \u2014 that monitors and corrects scooter safety issues in real time. The next-generation operating system that will provide those upgrades, codenamed &#8220;Briggs,&#8221; will be uploaded to its global fleet of LINK e-scooters. It includes improvements to geofencing capabilities and battery life, making Superpedestrian more attractive to cities looking for partners who can provide assurances around safety and reliability.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The scooter market has shifted in its short lifespan from a B2C to, in a lot of ways, more like a B2G [business-to-government],&#8221; said David Zipper, visiting fellow at the Taubman Center for State and Local Government at the Harvard Kennedy Center. &#8220;The trend has been for cities to reduce the number of concessions they grant to scooter operators, which puts more pressure on scooter operators to get one of those declining numbers of contracts available. You can&#8217;t really overstate how important it is, which technologies will rise and fall, and how companies position themselves.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Superpedestrian is one of the underdog e-scooter companies that are in the running for partnerships with cities like New York, which will soon be announcing the specifics of its <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/24\/new-york-city-could-have-an-e-scooter-pilot-program-by-march\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">e-scooter pilot program in the Bronx<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

We believe it is critical to work hand-in-hand with regulators to provide a successful service.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p>City officials today are most concerned with complaints about scooters cluttering up sidewalks, so being able to clear the sidewalk or diagnose a broken scooter right away and summon someone to come and collect it would be an appealing value proposition for Superpedestrian, said Zipper.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"hh4ts4cjKe\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/19\/10-investors-predict-maas-on-demand-delivery-and-evs-will-dominate-the-post-covid-future-of-mobility\/\">10 investors predict MaaS, on-demand delivery and EVs will dominate mobility&#8217;s post-pandemic future<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;10 investors predict MaaS, on-demand delivery and EVs will dominate mobility&#8217;s post-pandemic future&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/19\/10-investors-predict-maas-on-demand-delivery-and-evs-will-dominate-the-post-covid-future-of-mobility\/embed\/#?secret=hh4ts4cjKe\" data-secret=\"hh4ts4cjKe\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The LINK scooters are powered by a Vehicle Intelligent Safety (VIS) system, which combines AI, 73 sensors and five microprocessors to run 1,000 vehicle health checks every second a ride is taking place. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/19\/scooter-supplier-superpedestrian-raises-20-million-as-it-gears-up-to-launch\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The software is constantly self-monitoring and self-correcting<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, looking out for things like brake issues, battery cell temperature imbalances, cut internal wires and water penetration.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cVIS is as big a step-change in scooter safety as the seat belt was for cars, refined over four million miles of testing and service since 2013,\u201d said Ringham. &#8220;As a result, we\u2019ve had zero vehicle recalls or manufacturing defects globally.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new update also includes 22% faster geofence reaction, three time more capacity for onboard geofences and sevenfold more precision when it comes to geofence accuracy. That means the scooter is able to better recognize a no-ride zone, and improve rider compliance by slowing down speeds and prohibiting riding or parking in certain areas.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact that these computations are done in real time, locally on the scooter itself, accounts for the speed and accuracy of LINK\u2019s system, which reacts in as little as 0.7 seconds, and as few as 4.6 meters away from where a geofence-related issue was first detected. Other scooter companies tend to rely on cloud computing to calculate and enforce geofences, which can be too slow to stop riders from speeding through pedestrian areas or busy traffic.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur competitors typically buy off-the-shelf products and commonly use white label apps,\u201d said Ringham. \u201cWe do not outsource safety in this manner, meaning the information flows from our operations team and global fleets are used by our engineering teams to sustain continuous improvement.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Companies like Bird, Atom and Joyride offer white label operating systems that allow independent operators to launch their own rideshares and manage fleets, but not many players offer the type of safety-focused tech you see with LINK.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Detailed logs are also pulled by engineering teams to enhance performance with each updates, so the scooters get smarter over time, according to founder and CEO Assaf Biderman. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The aggregated and anonymized data collected from LINK\u2019s onboard software is also shared with city partners to help them design better infrastructure to support this emerging transport form.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf a city partner comes to us with a new idea, we can easily add that, thanks to VIS,\u201d Biderman said in a statement. \u201cThis makes for constantly-improving vehicles for riders, better protection for pedestrians and more robust safety performance for cities.

Through our conversations with more than 500 business leaders and work on nearly 300 board searches over the last year, as well as findings from our recent board benchmarking study, we\u2019ve identified five trends in the boardrooms of the United States\u2019 high-growth private companies.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<h2><strong>1. Board diversity is imperative<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Historically, board members have been tapped from the personal networks of those already in the boardroom. This approach optimizes for trust and convenience at the expense of diversity.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tWe expect to see continued improvement when it comes to racial and ethnic diversity in the years ahead.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>As pressure to diversity the boardroom mounts and societal challenges underscore the risks of the all-male board, companies are starting to take a more inclusive approach to board design. They are reaching outside their networks to appoint women and people of color, discovering that it\u2019s not a pipeline problem &#8212; it\u2019s a network problem. In one year\u2019s time, the percentage of late-stage private companies with all-male boards declined from 60% to 49%.<\/p>\n<p>While that\u2019s progress, the fact that nearly half of the most heavily funded venture-backed companies lack a single woman on the board underscores the enormous work still to be done. Today, only 11% of high-growth private company board seats are held by women and only 3% by women of color.<\/p>\n<p>However, we expect to see continued improvement when it comes to racial and ethnic diversity in the years ahead. Demand for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.himforher.org\/\">Him For Her<\/a> referrals to female board candidates nearly quadrupled in that last quarter of 2020 compared with a year prior, and among the new directors appointed, a quarter identify as Black or African American.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>2. Source candidates from across the entire C-suite<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When seeking independent directors, boards have traditionally favored CEO experience. Given the gender imbalance among CEOs, preference for that title instantly tips the scales in favor of male candidates.<\/p>\n<p>As boards look to add women, many have discovered the value of taking a more strategic approach to defining criteria for the next director. Instead of relying on the CEO title as a proxy for the desired qualities, boards now conduct a gap analysis, identifying the mix of key competencies that would be most valuable.<\/p>\n<p>The result: a rich pipeline of executive operators who contribute strategic perspective combined with cutting-edge best practices. In addition to CFOs ready to chair an audit committee, we\u2019ve had requests for operators with go-to-market expertise, product leaders known for driving innovation, and people officers who know how to build corporate culture. We\u2019ve even helped companies seeking, for example, business-savvy doctors, nurses and law-enforcement officers to bring the voice of their customers into the boardroom.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>3. Independents come earlier<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As CEOs look to add diversity and operating expertise to their boards, many are adding independent directors at an earlier stage. How early? \u201cIt\u2019s never too early to have an independent director on the board,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/12\/11\/how-to-build-a-diverse-board\/\">according to Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple<\/a>, where the first independent was appointed only a year after the company\u2019s founding.<\/p>\n<p>Over the last year, the percentage of the heavily funded private companies with at least one independent director grew from 71% to 84%, and the percentage of board seats held by independents grew from 20% to 25%, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/news.crunchbase.com\/news\/2020-diversity-study-on-private-company-boards\/\">2020 Study of Gender Diversity on Private Company Boards<\/a>. Among the board searches we\u2019ve conducted for privately held companies, more than 40% were Series B or earlier.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>4. The board Zoom is here to stay<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The pandemic drove boards onto screens, but even when health risks are mitigated, many will continue to convene virtually at least some of the time. The last year has caused companies to rethink the role of the physical office, and the importance of the physical boardroom is getting new scrutiny. Though most CEOs and directors will still favor in-person attendance for formal board meetings, we expect a new tolerance for remote participation and an increase in ad-hoc virtual meetings.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond reduced travel and ease of scheduling, there\u2019s a hidden benefit to virtual meetings that leaders would be wise to exploit: the reduced opportunity cost of more attendees. The impact of \u201canother body in the boardroom\u201d has long been an argument against allowing company executives to attend board meetings. We expect that, with a virtual format, CEOs will take advantage of the development opportunity to expose more of their leaders to board discussions.<\/p>\n<p>On the flip side, virtual meetings require a more conscious effort to build relationships. Boards will need to balance the convenience of virtual meetings with the value of in-person interactions in building rapport and fostering collaborative decision-making.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>5. Stakeholder capitalism takes root<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Propelled by increasing pressure in the public markets and by the growing number of consumers who make value-based purchasing decisions, private company boards will give sustainability more overt consideration in their decision-making. In his <a href=\"https:\/\/www.blackrock.com\/corporate\/investor-relations\/larry-fink-ceo-letter\">annual letter<\/a>, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink pointed to evidence of a \u201csustainability premium\u201d for companies that outperform their industry peers on ESG measures. As public companies standardize on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/60-major-companies-agree-to-start-reporting-on-esg-metrics-2021-1\">metrics and disclosure around ESG performance<\/a>, that discipline will extend into the boardrooms of companies that aim to compete in the global marketplace.<\/p>\n<p>Private companies drive innovation in nearly every corner of the economy, yet their boardrooms have remained remarkably unchanged over the last several decades. We expect that 2020 will prove to be an inflection point in corporate boardrooms; this period of board transformation will be defined by increased diversity and inclusion and a growing emphasis on sustainable value creation. As these initiatives take root, beneficiaries will include not just the companies and their investors, but employees, customers, suppliers and society at large.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"pzA3yyRgPx\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/30\/on-the-diversity-front-2020-may-prove-a-tipping-point\/\">On the diversity front, 2020 may prove a tipping point<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;On the diversity front, 2020 may prove a tipping point&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/30\/on-the-diversity-front-2020-may-prove-a-tipping-point\/embed\/#?secret=pzA3yyRgPx\" data-secret=\"pzA3yyRgPx\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Just as countless aspects of corporate life have been reshaped over the course of the last year, boards of directors are undergoing significant and lasting transformation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574430,"featured_media":2126643,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"05f6067a-15b0-3b61-b0a4-805bab334e48"},"categories":[25515,35027640,576818242,20429,35394854],"tags":[576655815,466222],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/GettyImages-1248900705.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3tBUG87","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":false,"premiumCutoffPercent":1,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[1922425,2126606],"hide_featured_image":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2126500"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2126500"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2126500\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2127663,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2126500\/revisions\/2127663"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/ann-shepherd"},{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/jocelyn-mangan"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2126500&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574430"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/2126643"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2126500"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2126500"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2126500"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2126500"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2126500"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2126500"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2126500"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":1922425,"name":"Ann Shepherd","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/ann-shepherd\/","description":"Ann Shepherd is co-founder of social impact venture <a href=\"http:\/\/www.himforher.org\">Him For Her<\/a>.

One for which social engagement is an inextricable component of the product. That is to say: If you removed the social element, the product would cease to make sense. You can find plenty of examples in gaming (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/90315238\/the-best-new-social-network-may-surprise-you\">Fortnite<\/a>), fitness (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.strava.com\/\">Strava<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.onepeloton.com\/\">Peloton<\/a>), commerce (<a href=\"https:\/\/en.pinduoduo.com\/\">Pinduoduo<\/a>), audio (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.joinclubhouse.com\/\">Clubhouse<\/a>) and more. As noted in Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s recent series <a href=\"https:\/\/a16z.com\/social-strikes-back\">Social Strikes Back<\/a>, \u201cThe best version of every consumer product is the one that\u2019s intrinsically social.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tSocial+ products are seeing mass adoption because they marry community with functionality.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<h2>The benefits of a social+ company<\/h2>\n<p>Social+ products are seeing mass adoption because they marry community with functionality. Users form meaningful connections \u2014 and engage in value-adding conversations \u2014 within the context of the goal they\u2019re trying to achieve. Whether it\u2019s shopping for a deal or growing their assets, social+ products help users gain new knowledge, find motivation, garner status, form friendships and generally feel like they\u2019re part of something.<\/p>\n<p>Companies that base their business model on social+ products enjoy a variety of benefits:<\/p>\n<h3>Growth<\/h3>\n<p>When the social aspect of a product is integral to its function, users will often drive growth on their own steam, inviting their friends and family to join the community.<\/p>\n<p>Members of highly engaged communities are inspired and fired up by their interactions with other members, and when they\u2019re fired up about something, they talk about it. Participating in these communities makes users feel like they\u2019re part of something, which can have a powerful effect on your growth.<\/p>\n<h3>Retention<\/h3>\n<p>Relationships matter. The relationship your users have with your brand is ultimately what will determine whether they stick with you or leave you for a competitor offering the same service \u2014 particularly at a more attractive price. If you provide your customers with access to a community they relate to and resources that make their lives easier, they\u2019re more likely to be loyal.<\/p>\n<p>The beauty of social+ is that embedding social interaction within your product or app allows you to own that conversation and build a community around your brand. In the absence of built-in communities, these users are forced to turn to places like Reddit or WhatsApp to discuss, among other things, the relative advantages of competitors\u2019 apps.<\/p>\n<h3>Harnessing the creativity of your users<\/h3>\n<p>User-generated content (UGC) is the lifeblood of any social+ product, driving user engagement and fostering connections among users. UGC means the company can harness the creativity and popularity of its users and doesn\u2019t have to expend as many resources creating content users find valuable. Plus there\u2019s the added bonus that authentic UGC \u2014 whether it\u2019s a screenshot or a meme \u2014 lends the product far greater credibility than any marketing initiatives you could launch.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The shift toward social+ is not going anywhere, and the fintech vertical is no exception.

challenged in the U.K., where the App Drivers &amp; Couriers Union (ADCU) and Worker Info Exchange (WIE) have called for Microsoft to suspend the ride-hailing giant&#8217;s use of <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/services\/cognitive-services\/face\/\">B2B facial recognition<\/a> after finding multiple cases where drivers were mis-identified and went on to have their licence to operate revoked by Transport for London (TfL).<\/p>\n<p>The union said it has identified seven cases of &#8220;failed facial recognition and other identity checks&#8221; leading to drivers losing their jobs and licence revocation action by TfL.<\/p>\n<p>When Uber launched the &#8220;Real Time ID Check&#8221; system in the U.K. in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uber.com\/en-GB\/blog\/real-time-id-check-uk-drivers\/\">April 2020<\/a>, it said it would &#8220;verify that driver accounts aren\u2019t being used by anyone other than the licensed individuals who have undergone an Enhanced DBS check&#8221;. It said then that drivers could &#8220;choose whether their selfie is verified by photo-comparison software or by our human reviewers&#8221;.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In one misidentification case the ADCU said the driver was dismissed from employment by Uber and his licence was revoked by TfL. The union adds that it was able to assist the member to establish his identity correctly, forcing Uber and TfL to reverse their decisions. But it highlights concerns over the accuracy of the Microsoft facial recognition technology &#8212; pointing out that the company <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-microsoft-facial-recognition-idUSKBN23I2T6\">suspended the sale of the system to U.S. police forces<\/a> in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests of last summer. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Research has shown that facial recognition systems can have an especially high error rate when used to identify people of color &#8212; and the ADCU cites a <a href=\"http:\/\/proceedings.mlr.press\/v81\/buolamwini18a\/buolamwini18a.pdf\">2018 MIT study<\/a> that found Microsoft\u2019s system can have an error rate as high as 20% (accuracy was lowest for dark-skinned women).<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The union said it&#8217;s written to the mayor of London to demand that all TfL private-hire driver licence revocations based on Uber reports using evidence from its Hybrid Real Time Identification systems are immediately reviewed.<\/p>\n<p>Microsoft has been contacted for comment on the call for it to suspend Uber&#8217;s licence for its facial recognition tech.<\/p>\n<p>The ADCU said Uber rushed to implement a workforce electronic surveillance and identification system as part of a package of measures implemented to regain its license to operate in the U.K. capital.<\/p>\n<p>Back in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/09\/22\/uber-loses-its-license-to-operate-in-london\/\">2017<\/a>, TfL made the shocking decision not to grant Uber a licence renewal &#8212; ratcheting up regulatory pressure on its processes and maintaining this hold in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/25\/uber-has-again-been-denied-licence-renewal-in-london-over-safety-risks\/\">2019<\/a> when it again deemed Uber &#8220;not fit and proper&#8221; to hold a private hire vehicle licence.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"pLdS5APnPy\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/28\/uber-wins-latest-london-licence-appeal\/\">Uber wins latest London licence appeal &#8212; but renewal is only for 18 months<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Uber wins latest London licence appeal &#8212; but renewal is only for 18 months&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/28\/uber-wins-latest-london-licence-appeal\/embed\/#?secret=pLdS5APnPy\" data-secret=\"pLdS5APnPy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Safety and security failures were a key reason cited by TfL for withholding Uber&#8217;s licence renewal.<\/p>\n<p>Uber has challenged TfL&#8217;s decision in court and it won another appeal against the licence suspension <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/28\/uber-wins-latest-london-licence-appeal\/\">last year<\/a> &#8212; but the renewal granted was for only 18 months (not the full five years). It also came with a <a href=\"https:\/\/content.tfl.gov.uk\/uber-licensing-appeal-licence-conditions-september-2020.pdf\">laundry list of conditions<\/a> &#8212; so Uber remains under acute pressure to meet TfL&#8217;s quality bar.<\/p>\n<p>Now, though, Labor activists are piling pressure on Uber from the other direction too &#8212; pointing out that no regulatory standard has been set around the workplace surveillance technology that the ADCU says TfL encouraged Uber to implement. No equalities impact assessment has even been carried out by TfL, it adds.<\/p>\n<p>WIE confirmed to TechCrunch that it&#8217;s filing a discrimination claim in the case of one driver, called Imran Raja, who was dismissed after Uber&#8217;s Real ID check &#8212; and had his licence revoked by TfL.<\/p>\n<p>His licence was subsequently restored &#8212; but only after the union challenged the action.<\/p>\n<p>A number of other Uber drivers who were also misidentified by Uber&#8217;s facial recognition checks will be appealing TfL&#8217;s revocation of their licences via the U.K. courts, per WIE.<\/p>\n<p>A spokeswoman for TfL told us it is not a condition of Uber&#8217;s licence renewal that it must implement facial recognition technology &#8212; only that Uber must have adequate safety systems in place.<\/p>\n<p>The relevant condition of its provisional licence on &#8220;driver identity&#8221; states:<\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 6\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<blockquote><p>ULL shall maintain appropriate systems, processes and procedures to confirm that a driver using the app is an individual licensed by TfL and permitted by ULL to use the app.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also asked TfL and the U.K.&#8217;s Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office for a copy of the data protection impact assessment Uber says was carried before the Real-Time ID Check was launched &#8212; and will update this report if we get it.<\/p>\n<p>Uber, meanwhile, disputes the union&#8217;s assertion that its use of facial recognition technology for driver identity checks risks automating discrimination because it says it has a system of manual (human) review in place that&#8217;s intended to prevent failures.<\/p>\n<p>Albeit it accepts that that system clearly failed in the case of Raja &#8212; who only got his Uber account back (and an apology) after the union&#8217;s intervention.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Uber said its Real-Time ID system involves an automated &#8220;picture matching&#8221; check on a selfie that the driver must provide at the point of log in, with the system comparing that selfie with a (single) photo of them held on file.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">If there&#8217;s no machine match, the system sends the query to a three-person human review panel to conduct a manual check. Uber said checks will be sent to a second human panel if the first can&#8217;t agree.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In a statement the tech giant told us:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our Real-Time ID Check is designed to protect the safety and security of everyone who uses the app by ensuring the correct driver or courier is using their account. The two situations raised do not reflect flawed technology &#8212; in fact one of the situations was a confirmed violation of our anti-fraud policies and the other was a human error.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;While no tech or process is perfect and there is always room for improvement, we believe the technology, combined with the thorough process in place to ensure a minimum of two manual human reviews prior to any decision to remove a driver, is fair and important for the safety of our platform.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>In two of the cases referred to by the ADCU, Uber said that in one instance a driver had shown a photo during the Real-Time ID Check instead of taking a selfie as required to carry out the live ID check &#8212; hence it argues it was not wrong for the ID check to have failed as the driver was not following the correct protocol.<\/p>\n<p>In the other instance Uber blamed human error on the part of its manual review team(s) who (twice) made an erroneous decision. It said the driver&#8217;s appearance had changed and its staff were unable to recognize the face of the (now bearded) man who sent the selfie as the same person in the clean-shaven photo Uber held on file.<\/p>\n<p>Uber was unable to provide details of what happened in the other five identity check failures referred to by the union.<\/p>\n<p>It also declined to specify the ethnicities of the seven drivers the union says were misidentified by its checks.<\/p>\n<p>Asked what measures it&#8217;s taking to prevent human errors leading to more misidentifications in the future, Uber declined to provide a response.<\/p>\n<p>Uber said it has a duty to notify TfL when a driver fails an ID check &#8212; a step that can lead to the regulator suspending the license, as happened in Raja&#8217;s case. So any biases in its identity check process clearly risk having disproportionate impacts on affected individuals&#8217; ability to work.<\/p>\n<p>WIE told us it knows of three TfL licence revocations that relate solely to facial recognition checks.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We know of more [UberEats] couriers who have been deactivated but no further action since they are not licensed by TfL,&#8221; it noted.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch also asked Uber how many driver deactivations have been carried out and reported to TfL in which it cited facial recognition in its testimony to the regulator &#8212; but again the tech giant declined to answer our questions.<\/p>\n<p>WIE told us it has evidence that facial recognition checks are incorporated into geo-location-based deactivations Uber carries out.<\/p>\n<p>It said that in one case a driver who had their account revoked was given an explanation by Uber relating solely to location but TfL accidentally sent WIE Uber&#8217;s witness statement &#8212; which it said &#8220;included facial recognition evidence&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>That suggests a wider role for facial recognition technology in Uber&#8217;s identity checks versus the one the ride-hailing giant gave us when explaining how its <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Real-Time ID system<\/span> works. (Again, Uber declined to answer follow-up questions about this or provide any other information beyond its on-the-record statement and related background points.)<\/p>\n<p>But even just focusing on Uber&#8217;s Real-Time ID system there&#8217;s the question of how much say Uber&#8217;s human review staff actually have in the face of machine suggestions combined with the weight of wider business imperatives (like an acute need to demonstrate regulatory compliance on the issue of safety).<\/p>\n<p>James Farrer, the founder of WIE, queries the quality of the human checks Uber has put in place as a backstop for facial recognition technology, which has a known discrimination problem.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Is Uber just confecting legal plausible deniability of automated decision making or is there meaningful human intervention,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;In all of these cases, the drivers were suspended and told the specialist team would be in touch with them. A week or so typically would go by and they would be permanently deactivated without ever speaking to anyone.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There is research out there to show when facial recognition systems flag a mismatch humans have bias to confirm the machine. It takes a brave human being to override the machine. To do so would mean they would need to understand the machine, how it works, its limitations and have the confidence and management support to over rule the machine,&#8221; Farrer added. &#8220;Uber employees have the risk of Uber&#8217;s license to operate in London to consider on one hand and what&#8230; on the other? Drivers have no rights and there are in excess so expendable.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>He also pointed out that Uber has previously said in court that it errs on the side of customer complaints rather than give the driver benefit of the doubt. &#8220;With that in mind can we really trust Uber to make a balanced decision with facial recognition?&#8221; he asked.<\/p>\n<p>Farrer further questioned why Uber and TfL don&#8217;t show drivers the evidence that&#8217;s being relied upon to deactivate their accounts &#8212; to given them a chance to challenge it via an appeal on the actual substance of the decision.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;IMHO this all comes down to tech governance,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt that Microsoft facial recognition is a powerful and mostly accurate tool. But the governance of this tech must be intelligent and responsible. Microsoft are smart enough themselves to acknowledge this as a limitation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The prospect of Uber pressured into surveillance tech as a price of keeping their licence&#8230; and a 94% BAME workforce with no worker rights protection from unfair dismissal is a recipe for disaster!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The latest pressure on Uber&#8217;s business processes follows hard on the heels of a major win for Farrer and other former Uber drivers and labor rights activists after <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/19\/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court\/\">years of litigation<\/a> over the company&#8217;s bogus claim that drivers are &#8220;self employed&#8221;, rather than workers under U.K. law.<\/p>\n<p>On <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/16\/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling\/\">Tuesday<\/a> Uber responded to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/19\/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court\/\">last month&#8217;s Supreme Court quashing of its appeal<\/a> saying it would now treat drivers as workers in the market &#8212; expanding the benefits it provides.<\/p>\n<p>However, the litigants immediately pointed out that Uber&#8217;s &#8220;deal&#8221; ignored the Supreme Court&#8217;s assertion that working time should be calculated when a driver logs onto the Uber app. Instead Uber said it would calculate working time entitlements when a driver accepts a job &#8212; meaning it&#8217;s still trying to avoid paying drivers for time spent waiting for a fare.<\/p>\n<p>The ADCU therefore estimates that Uber&#8217;s &#8220;offer&#8221; underpays drivers by between 40%-50% of what they are legally entitled to &#8212; and has said it will continue its legal fight to get a fair deal for Uber drivers.<\/p>\n<p>At an EU level, where regional lawmakers are looking at how to improve conditions for gig workers, the tech giant is now pushing for an employment law carve out for platform work &#8212; and has been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/17\/uber-could-give-gig-workers-a-better-deal-but-its-lobbying-eu-to-lower-standards-says-fairwork\/\">accused of trying to lower legal standards for workers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ejqJHPS7eE\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/30\/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook\/\">Understanding Europe&#8217;s big push to rewrite the digital rulebook<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Understanding Europe&#8217;s big push to rewrite the digital rulebook&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/30\/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook\/embed\/#?secret=ejqJHPS7eE\" data-secret=\"ejqJHPS7eE\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>In additional<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/12\/dutch-court-rejects-uber-drivers-robo-firing-charge-but-tells-ola-to-explain-algo-deductions\/\">\u00a0Uber-related news<\/a> this month, a court in the Netherlands ordered the company to hand over more of the data it holds on drivers, following another ADCU+WIE challenge. Although the court rejected the majority of the drivers&#8217; requests for more data. But notably it did not object to drivers seeking to use data rights established under EU law to obtain information collectively to further their ability to collectively bargain against a platform &#8212; paving the way for more (and more carefully worded) challenges as Farrer spins up his data trust for workers.<\/p>\n<p>The applicants also sought to probe Uber&#8217;s use of algorithms for fraud-based driver terminations under an article of EU data protection law that provides for a right not to be subject to solely automated decisions in instances where there is a legal or significant effect. In that case the court accepted Uber&#8217;s explanation at face value that fraud-related terminations had been investigated by a human team &#8212; and that the decisions to terminate involved meaningful human decisions.<\/p>\n<p>But the issue of meaningful human invention\/oversight of platforms&#8217; algorithmic suggestions\/decisions is shaping up to be a key battleground in the fight to regulate the human impacts of and societal imbalances flowing from powerful platforms which have both god-like view of users&#8217; data and an allergy to complete transparency.<\/p>\n<p>The latest challenge to Uber&#8217;s use of facial recognition-linked terminations shows that interrogation of the limits and legality of its automated decisions is far from over &#8212; really, this work is just getting started.<\/p>\n<p>Uber&#8217;s use of geolocation for driver suspensions is also facing legal challenge.<\/p>\n<p>While pan-EU legislation now being negotiated by the bloc&#8217;s institutions also aims to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/30\/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook\/\">increase platform transparency requirements<\/a> &#8212; with the prospect of added layers of regulatory oversight and even algorithmic audits coming down the pipe for platforms in the near future.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/12\/dutch-court-rejects-uber-drivers-robo-firing-charge-but-tells-ola-to-explain-algo-deductions\/\">Last week<\/a> the same Amsterdam court that ruled on the Uber cases also ordered India-based ride-hailing company Ola to disclose data about its facial-recognition-based &#8220;Guardian&#8221; system &#8212; aka its equivalent to Uber&#8217;s Real-Time ID system. The court said Ola must provide applicants with a wider range of data than it currently does &#8212; including disclosing a &#8220;fraud probability profile&#8221; it maintains on drivers and data within a &#8220;Guardian&#8221; surveillance system it operates.<\/p>\n<p>Farrer says he&#8217;s thus confident that workers will get transparency &#8212; &#8220;one way or another&#8221;. And after years fighting Uber through U.K. courts over its treatment of workers his tenacity in pursuit of rebalancing platform power cannot be in doubt.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"c8jYA6N5Pu\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/12\/dutch-court-rejects-uber-drivers-robo-firing-charge-but-tells-ola-to-explain-algo-deductions\/\">Dutch court rejects Uber drivers&#8217;

While that could be true, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.srgresearch.com\/articles\/2020-the-year-that-cloud-service-revenues-finally-dwarfed-enterprise-spending-on-data-centers\">new research from Synergy Research Group<\/a> found that cloud infrastructure spending surpassed on-prem spending for the first time in 2020 &#8212; and did so by a wide margin.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;New data from Synergy Research Group shows that enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services continued to ramp up aggressively in 2020, growing by 35% to reach almost $130 billion. Meanwhile enterprise spending on data center hardware and software dropped by 6% to under $90 billion,&#8221; the firm said in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>While the numbers have been trending toward the cloud for a decade, the spending favored on-prem software until last year when the two numbers pulled even, according to Synergy data. John Dinsdale, chief analyst and research director at Synergy says that this new data shows that CIOs have shifted their spending to the cloud in 2020.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Where the rubber meets the road is what are companies spending their money on, and that is what we are covering here. Quite clearly CIOs are choosing to spend a lot more money on cloud services and are severely crimping their spend on on-prem (or collocated) data center assets,&#8221; Dinsdale told me.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2127540\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2127540\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2127540 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Ent-Spending-2020.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Chart comparing on prem spending to cloud infrastructure spending from Synergy Research.\" width=\"680\" height=\"433\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Ent-Spending-2020.jpg 1207w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Ent-Spending-2020.jpg?resize=150,96 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Ent-Spending-2020.jpg?resize=300,191 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Ent-Spending-2020.jpg?resize=768,489 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Ent-Spending-2020.jpg?resize=680,433 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Ent-Spending-2020.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2127540\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Synergy Research Group<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The total for on-prem spending includes servers, storage, networking, security and related software required to run the hardware. &#8220;The software pieces included in this data is mainly server OS and virtualization software. Comparing SaaS with on-prem business apps software is a whole other story,&#8221; Dinsdale said.<\/p>\n<p>As we see on-prem\/cloud numbers diverging in this way, it&#8217;s worth asking how these numbers compare to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gartner.com\/en\/newsroom\/press-releases\/2020-10-20-gartner-says-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-4-percent-in-2021\">research from Gartner<\/a> and others that the cloud remains a relatively small percentage of global IT spend. As workloads move back and forth in today&#8217;s hybrid world, Dinsdale says that makes it difficult to quantify where it lives at any given moment.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"b0SxBXQ30t\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/22\/customer-experience-and-digital-transformation-concepts-are-merging-during-the-pandemic\/\">Customer experience and digital transformation concepts are merging during the pandemic<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Customer experience and digital transformation concepts are merging during the pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/22\/customer-experience-and-digital-transformation-concepts-are-merging-during-the-pandemic\/embed\/#?secret=b0SxBXQ30t\" data-secret=\"b0SxBXQ30t\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;I\u2019ve seen plenty of comments about only a small percentage of workloads running on public clouds.
