and lawmakers across the aisle are increasingly calling out the Biden administration for a lack of press access at border processing centers, a media blackout preventing reporters from covering what the White House has refused to call a crisis, despite firsthand accounts suggesting otherwise. Immigration detention facilities, overcrowded with unaccompanied children amid the surge of migrants at the southwestern border, are reportedly holding some minors longer than legal 72-hour limit, according to Senator <strong>Shelley Moore Capito</strong>, among the bipartisan group of senators who last week traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border with Homeland Security Secretary <strong>Alejandro Mayorkas</strong>. âIâm very alarmed about the numbers and extremely concerned about the overstay in the facility,â Capito <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senators-border-minors-press-access/2021/03/20/c4ce50ce-89c2-11eb-8a67-f314e5fcf88d_story.html\">told</a> the <em>Washington Post</em> of a Customs and Border Protection processing center in El Paso, Texas, where she said as many as 100 migrant children who arrived unaccompanied were being held in one large room, raising both policy and public health concerns. âTheyâll move 50 out a night [and] have another 100 come in that night,â the West Virginia Republican said. After 72 hours, CBP facilities are required by law to transfer the unaccompanied children and teens in their custody to the care of Health and Human Services.</p>\n<p>News organizations, however, are struggling to cover what Capito called âheart-rendingâ circumstances and overstay due to limited media access to such government facilities. âWe want to make sure that the press has access to hold the administration accountable,â Senator <strong>Chris Murphy</strong>, another lawmakers who went on the trip, <a href=\"https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-gives-firsthand-account-of-border-trip-on-nprs-weekend-edition\">said</a> on NPR Saturday, noting that conditions are âbetter than what we saw in 2019â and ânot kids in so-called cagesâ but nevertheless somewhere âyou wouldnât want your child in for more than 10 minutes,â with kids âsleeping on thin mattresses on the floorâ and spaced âabout six inches to a foot from each other.â During the interview, Murphy said he believes âthereâs a way for DHS to allow some additional press accessâ into the detention centers, where âright now these kids are staying too long.â A day earlier, the Connecticut Democrat shared his immediate reaction to the trip:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1373018632213565443\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1373018632213565443\">https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1373018632213565443</a></p></blockquote></div><p>The lawmakersâ calls echo those of journalists highlighting the lack of media access to the border situation amid the increasing surge of migrants, with the <em>Post</em> on Saturday <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-border-surge/2021/03/20/21824e94-8818-11eb-8a8b-5cf82c3dffe4_story.html\">reporting</a> that more than 10,000 unaccompanied migrant children are currently in the care of DHS and 5,000 more are in CBP custody&#8212;almost twice the previous record. âThe President promised things would be different. Turns out he was right, but in this case not the way we had hoped,â said <strong>Dan Shelley</strong>, the executive director of the Radio Television Digital News Foundation, in a <a href=\"https://www.rtdna.org/article/rtdna_calls_on_secretary_mayorkas_department_of_homeland_security_to_allow_journalists_access_to_board_patrol_facilities_officials\">statement</a> last week, noting that the Trump administration provided the press photos and access to juvenile facilities&#8212;albeit, as NBCâs <strong>Jacob Soboroff</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jacobsoboroff/status/1372617524605423617?s=20\">noted</a>, for the purpose of advertising âthe cruelty of the separation policy. They wanted everyone to see that.â Regardless, Soboroff continued, âNow it&#39;s the Biden administration&#39;s turn to open the doors.â</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/jbmoorephoto/status/1372924066894651392\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbmoorephoto/status/1372924066894651392\">https://twitter.com/jbmoorephoto/status/1372924066894651392</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Despite the administrationâs insistence on being âcommitted to transparency,â as <strong>Jen Psaki</strong>, the White House press secretary, <a href=\"https://view.newsletters.cnn.com/messages/16162086232564fec8af80afe/raw?utm_term=16162086232564fec8af80afe&amp;utm_source=cnn_Reliable+Sources+-+March+19+2021&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=1616208623257&amp;bt_ee=WVCdEmHas%2BgR7OQgNTfQ3GPhrhxgWUbVIVf3WfngjISM%2Fi%2B2QtNOePURJVjT1yk3&amp;bt_ts=1616208623257\">reiterated</a> in a statement to CNNâs <strong>Oliver Darcy</strong> on Friday, its apparent reluctance is drawing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PamelaBrownCNN/status/1373439482477867010?s=20\">heightened attention</a> to the situation that the White House is already struggling to get under control&#8212;as critics of the president have been quick to capitalize on. âAfter years of bashing the news media, some Republicans and right-wing media outlets have suddenly morphed into press advocates,â Darcy reported, pointing to Senator <strong>Ted Cruz</strong>âs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1372971728993988613?s=20\">tweet</a> calling the lack of press and camera with Mayorkas âoutrageous &amp; unacceptable.â On Thursday evening, Fox Newsâ <strong>Sean Hannity</strong> chimed in. âTheyâre now telling Border Patrol agents, no ride-alongs, any media requests send them to Washington,â he said. âThatâs not transparent. What competent government&#8212;what are they trying to hide?â As the <em>Post</em>âs <strong>Erik Wemple</strong> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/03/19/news-orgs-cite-biden-administration-opacity-border-stories/\">put it</a>: âYou know things are bad when Hannity doesnât even need to

The concerts bring in an estimated $100 million to the region each year, the AP reported.</p>\n<p>The 2021 season will be roughly half the length it usually is, however, and shows will be truncated with no intermission to about 80 minutes. (Hey, Gustav Mahler, snip a little from the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZgxEXuLFEs\">Symphony No. 3 in D Minor</a> and the BSO may fit you in!) Additionally, all ticketing will be contactless, and mask-wearing and social distancing will be enforced.</p>\n<p>Tanglewood is one of the sacred sites for classical music lovers in North America. Longtime patron Philip Roth set an emotionally resonant scene there in the PEN/Faulkner Award-winning 2000 novel <em>The Human Stain</em>. Conductors and composers associated with the BSO or Tanglewood Music Center include Serge Koussevitzky, Charles MÃ¼nch, Leonard Bernstein, Seiji Ozawa, Leon Fleischer, and James Levine. Jazz, pop, and rock acts play there as well. (The Beach Boys nudged the door open in 1965, then Janis Joplin in 1969.

a wild-seeming rumor raging on Twitter, <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> reached out to director <strong>Chris Columbus</strong> for some clarification. No, of course, not, there was never an NC-17 cut of the 1993 family comedy <em>Mrs. Doubtfire</em>. But there was, however, an R-rated cut.</p>\n<p>The online buzz began late Thursday when a tweet from an account called @factsonfilm stated that &quot;while filming &#39;Mrs. Doubtfire&#39; (1993), Robin Williams improvised so much that there were PG, PG-13, R, and NC-17 cuts of the film.&quot; There was no sourcing for this alleged fact, but it likely comes from an interview with Columbus published in 2015 by <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/directors-reel-chris-columbus-on-adventures-in-124936621212.html\">Yahoo! Movies</a>. The director, whose resume also includes <em>Adventures in Babysitting</em>, <em>Home Alone</em>, and <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone</em>, used some pretty obvious hyperbole when discussing his working relationship with the film&#39;s star.</p>\n<p>Columbus explained that he and Williams, whose mÃ©tier was improvisation, had a deal. They&#39;d get a few scripted takes down, and then Williams would have time to do and say whatever he wanted. For certain setups, they&#39;d have multiple cameras to be sure to capture reactions from other actors who never knew what Williams would say.</p>\n<p>&quot;He would sometimes go into territory that wouldn&#39;t be appropriate for a PG-13 movie, but certainly appropriate and hilariously funny for an R-rated film,&quot; Columbus explained to <em>EW</em>. &quot;I only [previously] used the phrase NC-17 as a joke. There could be no NC-17 version of the movie.&quot;</p>\n<p>There were three cuts of the film one of which was given an R. The version that was released was PG-13.</p>\n<p>Given just how bananas the Internet went over the idea, a &quot;Release The Improv Cut!&quot; movement might gain momentum.

It should inspire many small- to medium-sized businesses, tour operators, taxi drivers, restaurants and retailers to prepare for brighter days ahead, the best we have ever had,&quot; said <strong>The Most Hon.

It would not end like <em>Rocky IV</em>&#8212;I donât think the American would prevail,â Republican representative <strong>Matt Gaetz</strong> told <strong>Sean Hannity</strong> on Thursday.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1372910156116287490\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1372910156116287490\">https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1372910156116287490</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Hannity, obviously, agreed. âThe question is this,â he said. âWhy would Vladimir Putin immediately call for a debate with Joe Biden with no time to prepare? What have I been saying? What have some of us&#8212;half the American people&#8212;been saying?â (Hannity, of course, has been baselessly claiming Biden is in cognitive decline, which Republicans also swore was the case before the presidential debates, and then had to pivot to claiming Biden was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/09/donald-trump-joe-biden-drugs\" target=\"_blank\">taking performance-enhancing drugs</a>.) âItâs getting a little scary,â Hannity <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/sean-hannity-biden-cognitive-problems-becoming-worrisome\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> earlier this month. âItâs funny because the media was attacking me for saying that Joe looks weak and he looks frail and heâs struggling cognitively. Well, every day now, pretty much, when he speaks, when heâs allowed to speak, heâs struggling.â In fact, Biden has spoken publicly numerous times since taking office, including a prime-time address.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the presidentâs namesake and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/04/mueller-report-confirms-don-jr-too-stupid-to-collude-with-russia\" target=\"_blank\">arguably dumbest child</a> had this to say:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1372650008844103681\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1372650008844103681\">https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1372650008844103681</a></p></blockquote></div><p>In fact, Putin wanted Juniorâs father in office because he knew just how thoroughly he could manipulate him for reasons that remain unclear (though will perhaps <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/07/10/does-trump-owe-russia-the-supreme-courts-ruling-on-the-presidents-taxes-may-eventually-give-us-answers/\" target=\"_blank\">one day be revealed</a>), and is likely worried about what Biden <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/17/politics/joe-biden-vladimir-putin-price-to-pay/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">has in store for him</a>. Thatâs something he never had to be concerned about when Trump was in office, as his favorite little babushka doll would never even <em>dream</em> of crossing him.Â </p>\n<p><br>\n\\</p>\n<p><strong>Report: The White House is pretty uncool about weed</strong></p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/biden-white-house-sandbags-staffers-sidelines-dozens-for-pot-use\" target=\"_blank\">a report</a> from the Daily Beast, numerous people have been told their ass is grass:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dozens of young White House staffers have been suspended, asked to resign, or placed in a remote work program due to past marijuana use, frustrating staffers who were pleased by initial indications from the Biden administration that recreational use of cannabis would not be immediately disqualifying for would-be personnel, according to three people familiar with the situation. The policy has even affected staffers whose marijuana use was exclusive to one of the 14 states&#8212;and the District of Columbia&#8212;where cannabis is legal.</p>\n<p>In some cases, staffers were informally told by transition higher-ups ahead of formally joining the administration that they would likely overlook some past marijuana use, only to be asked later to resign. âThere were one-on-one calls with individual affected staffers&#8212;rather, ex-staffers,â one former White House staffer affected by the policy told the Daily Beast. âI was asked to resign.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Daily Beast notes that rules about prior marijuana use and their impact on security clearance eligibility vary by agency; for example, at the FBI, an applicant cannot have partaken in the previous three years, while at the NSA, itâs just one. But the White House âlargely calls its own shots.âÂ For example, <strong>Alyssa Mastromonaco,</strong> deputy chief of staff for operations in the Obama administration and a self-described âlove[r] of the ganj,â was allowed to join the administration (though she says she was ârandomly drug-tested pretty much once a month for the first year, and regularly after that.â)</p>\n<p>In response to the report, White House Press Secretary <strong>Jen Psaki</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/1372921409509462018\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted</a> that âof the hundreds of people hired, only five people who had started working at the White House are no longer employed as a result of this policy.â (As the Daily Beast notes, Psaki did not indicate how many people had been disqualified for a White House gig before actually starting.) âI find it absurd that, in 2021, marijuana use is still part of a security clearance background check,â <strong>Tommy Vietor,</strong> an Obama administration veteran, said Thursday. âTo me, marijuana use is completely irrelevant when youâre trying to decide whether an individual should be trusted with national security information.â</p>\n<p><strong>ICYMI: Rep. Lauren Boebert is still all in on QAnon</strong></p>\n<p>The Colorado congresswoman will not sit idly by while <strong>Marjorie Taylor Greene</strong> gets all the press for being the Houseâs resident crazy person. Per the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/boebert-gop-qanon-congress-democrats-b1819868.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Independent</em></a><em>:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>BoebertÂ has shared aÂ QAnonÂ conspiracy claiming that theÂ GOPÂ will retakeÂ CongressÂ following a supposed wave ofÂ DemocraticÂ resignations and arrestsâ¦. The theory, which would see Republicans gain control the House and Senate before the 2022 elections, has been pushed by the right-wingÂ <em>Epoch Times</em>. Ms. Boebert reportedly told her constituents at the event earlier this week that her sources were close to the ex-president.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>âAnd this is my opinion with that information that I have, I believe we will see resignations begin to take place,â Boebert said, adding that she has âvery good sources that tell me this is very good information. Is it 100 percent? I donât know but itâs very good information.â As a reminder, among other things, QAnon believers <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/02/marjorie-taylor-greene-fake-mea-culpa\" target=\"_blank\">think</a> Democrats are Satan-worshipping pedophiles who eat children.

the past, I have written a lot of essays and political op-eds about racism and sexism, rivers of words arguing for and explaining varieties of the ongoing, abiding fight to get free. This is not what Iâm writing today. On Tuesday, three days ago, a white gunman allegedly shot and killed eight people at three Asian massage parlors in the Atlanta area, including six Asian women, in a racist, sexist attack on massage parlor workers, and today I am not spending any more of my limited time alive defending the humanity of marginalized people, arguing once again with those who donât already see it that we are all fully realized people deserving of human rights. This long, hard week, I have felt especially pulled toward the company of fellow Asian women, so that is who I will write to here.</p>\n<p><em>To</em> Asian women, not for&#8212;thereâs no speaking for us, splendidly vast and manifold as our people are. And my experience of this world, and of America, is that of being a Korean American woman born in Seoul, so let me be specific about the body I inhabit: I moved to the U.S. with my family when I was three years old. I write and teach for a living; Iâve worked in the service industry, at a restaurant, but not since college. It is by no means a given that my life has a lot of overlap with the six Asian women killed while working at massage parlors, even the four women of Korean descent, except that much of America has trouble telling any of us apart.</p>\n<p>It is a standing, pain-riddled joke with close Asian women friends that if we havenât yet been mistaken for each other, weâre not really friends, and my friends laugh, and I laugh, and still they keep mixing us up. To date, I have been mistaken for Asian women who are almost a foot taller than I am, with women 15 years younger or older, biracial people, women who descend from every East Asian and Southeast Asian nation, plus Sri Lanka, as well as India, all of us thrown together by the willful, lazy illogic of racism.</p>\n<p>But I love being in this company&#8212;I love it here, with my sisters. I always have, and thereâs not anywhere else Iâd want to be. With femme-presenting siblings too, though here I hesitate, as I know at least some nonbinary friends prefer not to be categorized with women. It is also true, as many have pointed out, that when it comes to gender-based violence from male strangers, femme-presenting people who arenât women are of course vulnerable, so Iâll write this to you if you want to be here, and not if you donât. And while our siblings of color live with and are killed by white supremacy too, and while our sisters of color and our white sisters live with and are killed by misogyny too, today I have to write to us first, with the Asian women who have been crying all week, who are grief-stricken, furious, afraid, and heartsick, our bodies rioting beneath the heft and bulk of a racist, misogynist tragedy while we <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AAAJ_Atlanta/status/1372641926575427586\">mourn</a>.</p>\n<p>Dear Asian women living in America,</p>\n<p>Until this week, though Iâd often tried, I wasnât able to bring myself to tell my parents to watch out for the <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2021/02/the-us-is-seeing-a-massive-spike-in-anti-asian-hate-crimes.html\">upsurge in anti-Asian attacks</a>, in part because I canât bear it that they moved to this country mostly for my brotherâs and my sake. A lot of you have had this experience too, especially but not at all only during the past year, as weâve seen and heard reports of Asian people being <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/03/10/oakland-robbery-assault-asianamerican-man/\">shoved</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/03/19/san-francisco-asian-attack-arrest/\">punched</a>, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/asian-man-stabbed-back-york-citys-chinatown-suspect/story?id=76133248\">knifed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.q13fox.com/news/man-charged-with-two-random-brutal-attacks-in-seattles-chinatown-international-district\">hit with a sock filled with rocks</a>, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/04/06/brooklyn-woman-burned-outside-home-in-possible-acid-attack/\">disfigured in a possible acid attack</a>, and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/asian-man-stabbed-back-york-citys-chinatown-suspect/story?id=76133248\">killed by strangers</a>, as our elders are attacked and <a href=\"https://abc7news.com/oakland-asian-attack-teaunte-bailey-pak-ho-chesa-boudin/10412069/\">at times killed while theyâre walking down the street</a>, as slurs and hatred are thrown our way by everyone from online harassers to the previous president of this country.</p>\n<p>Lately, every time Iâve heard about, read about, or encountered a fresh incident of hatred, the quiet refrain belling in my head like a chant, or a dirge, is: <em>our hearts are breaking.</em> Iâve found this frustrating, for who does it help, what action is involved in having a breaking heart? Iâm listening more, though, today, to this refrain. Minutes after I first read about the attacks, I started thinking about what I should <em>do,</em> how I could be useful. Maybe I need to take another minute, maybe several minutes, to sit with this breaking heart.</p>\n<p>I will carry for a long time, for instance, the moment I first saw the Korean victimsâ names written in Korean. In hangul, which I associate with joy, with homecoming. With deep, good safety. It is the language written on the books in my parentsâ house, on the menus of restaurants I turn to when I really miss my motherâs food, in the birthday cards my parents send, retelling me the story of my birth in Seoul. This time, the hangul marked the passing of women shot for what they looked like, killed by a racist gunman and by this countryâs white supremacy.</p>\n<p>For a moment, though, I want to go back to that flicker of homecoming. Itâs not just that I love being a Korean woman; I also love that my life is full of Korean women. No one is more intimidating to me than ferocious Korean women, and it is part of my lifeâs work to try to more fully be one of these women. The prospects improve with age, I think. Our mothers are alarming; our grandmothers are terrifying. In my group chats with Korean women, when one of us has been insulted, a conversational leitmotif is that we almost pity the offending person&#8212;who is most often white, a man, or both&#8212;for fucking with us, for not having understood what kind of long-lasting trouble theyâve just heaped upon their own heads.</p>\n<p>I love our care for one another, our devotion, and now Iâm back to talking about Asian women. A powerful urge to care for our people is a blessing, but it can also be a burden, one that has felt especially heavy, perhaps, these past months. One that has made this heartbreak also feel like a kind of failure. Those of us who are immigrants, or the children of immigrants, have from a young age taken on the role of protecting those of our elders whose tongues were shaped in other lands. We grew up interpreting for them, and we put ourselves between them and rude, racist strangers, and we flared up with rage for our elders while they told us not to worry, they were fine.</p>\n<p>As a result, it has perhaps felt all the more brutal that we canât quite protect our own elders. Elders who, in a lot of cases, moved to this country for us. Many of us have also been physically distanced from those we love most by this pandemic, and so it can feel as though weâre failing in this respect too, by not having been able to be there to keep our loves safe from a virus for which they, and we, are being blamed.</p>\n<p>And meanwhile, others are failing us. Have been failing us. The media is buying into and merrily spreading the killerâs lies about his massacre not being racist. They publish his name and print his photo so that, much as I have tried to avoid it&#8212;reading the news with a hand held up to block out his face&#8212;I will carry that image to my grave, as I know many of you will. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/03/17/atlanta-spa-shootings-live-updates/\">Weâre told</a> that the killer couldnât hold out against the âtemptationâ of Asian womenâs bodies. Before we even knew their names, there were assumptions that the killed women were sex workers&#8212;as though that justified the massacre. It does not, and sex work is work; all sex workers deserve the full rights we all should already have. There has still been little reporting on who these women were. Some of you are journalists, and Asian American reporters fluent in the languages some of the murdered women spoke with their families are being told they canât report on the massacre because they <a href=\"https://aaja.org/2021/03/18/aaja-encourages-newsrooms-to-empower-aapi-journalists-and-their-expertise\">might be too biased</a>, although a white journalist&#8212;steeped in this countryâs white supremacy, probably unable to fluently speak with witnesses and family members&#8212;will most likely be especially ill-equipped to tell these stories well and responsibly. One of the first responses from local governments has been to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/19/atlanta-shooting-asian-police-violence\">increase policing in predominantly Asian areas</a>, while many Asian <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AAAJ_Atlanta/status/1372306491231899657\">activists</a> and massage-parlor workers and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Q0mFJnivTZL5fcCS7eUZn9EhOJ1XHtFBGOGqVaUY_8/edit\">sex workers</a> and community leaders have said increased policing will only hurt us, not help us.</p>\n<p>Weâve had to yell so loudly to even get national media and politicians to begin to believe there might be a real problem. I wept, as many of you did, the day last March when the previous president <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/20/coronavirus-trump-chinese-virus/\">started calling it a âChinese virus,â</a> because we knew exactly what would happen as a result, the hatred those paired words would incite. We have been told this is new, that we havenât really experienced racism, all while our entire existence in this country has been twisted, shaped, and contorted by forces like the <a href=\"https://immigrationhistory.org/item/page-act/\">1875 Page Act</a>, which halted the immigration of Chinese women on the stated pretext that they, we, were immoral. Were <em>temptations.</em> All while the Asia&#8211;ravaging forces of white supremacy, imperialism, and colonialism drove our people here, to this land our ancestors would not recognize.</p>\n<p>Some of these failures have come from the people closest to us. So many white friends, family members, colleagues, partners, in-law relatives, and teachers have brushed away, minimized, or entirely ignored our growing alarm. One of the first white men with whom I brought up rising anti-Asian racism replied by asking if this racism was really even happening. I had just told him it was. The silences this week ring loud, in the texts we havenât received, in the absences on social media, as the people who say they deeply love us, who have heard us talk about this, fail to wonder if weâre okay, fail to see if in this time of great collective sorrow it might be a good time to offer us some of that love.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, after the prolonged delay, I finally did talk to my mother, and I asked her to please take extra care when leaving the house. I was trying not to cry, and of course I failed, and of course my mother immediately tried to reassure me. She listed all the reasons she felt okay going to the store&#8212;she had this list ready, sheâd been thinking it through&#8212;and then she started trying to convince me, the one in less danger, not to leave my apartment. If I did leave, she proposed I talk more loudly than usual in English, the hope being that racist white people would know I belonged.</p>\n<p>In other words, sheâd worried about me, and Iâd worried about her, and neither of us had said a word to each other about our long-standing worry because we didnât want to cause each other any additional pain. It hurts. It all hurts. Still and always, hypersexualized, ignored, gaslit, marginalized, and disrespected as weâve been, I am so fortified, so alive, when Iâm with us. And I am thankful to the many other people, especially our Black and brown siblings who live with systemic injustice, unending police violence, and profound marginalization, who know to extend us their love, along with at least some white people. Recently, I was talking with a close friend, the writer <strong>Ingrid Rojas Contreras,</strong> about some of the complications of our lives as women of color, and she said, in a moment that felt like a cloud breaking, like clarity, âWe matter to me.â You matter to me, we matter to me, and I would so much rather have us and our allies on our side than any of them. For we already belong.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><strong>More Great Stories From</strong> <strong><em>Vanity Fair</em></strong></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Why <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/03/meghan-and-harry-revelations-about-racism-within-the-royal-family?itm_content=footer-recirc\">Meghan and Harryâs Revelations About Racism</a> Within the Royal Family Were So Devastating<br>\n&#8212; After <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/03/the-year-of-no-bras-pandemic-anniversary?itm_content=footer-recirc\">the Year of No Bras,</a> Things Are Looking Up<br>\n&#8212; The <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/03/hamptons-donald-trump-jr-and-kimberly-guilfoyle-sold-mansion?itm_content=footer-recirc\">Hamptons Rids Itself of Donald Trump Jr.</a> Ahead of High Season<br>\n&#8212; The New, Sad Irony of <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/03/prince-william-prince-harry-rift?itm_content=footer-recirc\">the Rift Between Prince William and Prince Harry</a><br>\n&#8212; Caroline Rose Giulianiâs Unicorn Tale: <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/03/caroline-giuliani-on-three-way-sex-with-couples?itm_content=footer-recirc\">Three-Way Sex Has Made Me a Better Person</a><br>\n&#8212; A Brief History of <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/03/history-piers-morgan-comments-on-meghan-markle?itm_content=footer-recirc\">Piers Morganâs One-Sided TV Feud</a> With Meghan Markle<br>\n&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2021/03/20-women-owned-fashion-brands-for-celebrating-womens-history-month?itm_content=footer-recirc\">20 Women-Owned Fashion Brands</a> for Celebrating Womenâs History Month<br>\n&#8212; From the Archive: Meghan Markle, <a href=\"https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/2018/5/an-american-princess?itm_content=footer-recirc\">an American Princess</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Not a subscriber? <a href=\"https://subscribe.vanityfair.com/subscribe/splits/vanityfair/VYF_SELF?source=HCL_VYF_GENERAL_LINK_0\">Join <em>Vanity Fair</em></a> to receive full access to VF.com and the complete online archive now.</p>","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"channels":[{"id":"5ae9f11ff5bec5053bd80396","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Style","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"style"}]},"channel":"Style","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5edc04b0d991ee5f708bd9da","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","email":"","name":"R.O.

But none brought me more joy than a slim book that isnât for the coffee table at all and had no actual photos of spaces, <a href=\"https://www.greenlightbookstore.com/book/9781452179674\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Artists in Residence</em></a><em>,</em> written by <strong>Melissa Wyse</strong> and illustrated by <strong>Kate Lewis</strong></p>\n<p>Lewis renders the homes of 17 artists, from <strong>Hassan Hajjaj</strong> to Georgia OâKeeffe, in bright watercolor, while Wyse describes their relationship to their spaces, especially when it comes to their work. Hajjaj played with the public and private, opening his tearoom in Morocco to visitors as if it were a museum. Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant redefined their shared domesticity with an effort to take interiors seriously, and painted murals or little motifs to highlight a placeâs architecture. Clementine Hunter cocooned her home in patterned wallpaper, putting it not just on the walls but on the ceiling too, giving the area a sense of warmth and color mirrored in her work.Â </p>\n<p>Wyse and Lewisâs book was all set and delivered to the publisher prior to the pandemic, which is a blessing. It contains no hand-wringing over what it all means to be situated in place for a prolonged period of time, and it can live as a piece separate from the pandemic, yet enriched by it.Â </p>\n<p>So leave the hand-wringing to me. This time last year we were thinking, âTwo weeks at home.â If everybody laid low for a mere two weeks, we could snuff the thing out. Just <em>two weeks</em> in our homes. One year later we can laugh to keep from crying at the naÃ¯vetÃ©.</p>\n<div class=\"callout feature-small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>It was also this week last year that somebody <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rosannecash/status/1238700345548627969\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted about Shakespeare writing <em>King Lear</em></a><em>,</em> aÂ sentiment meant to inspire that only depressed. Write <em>King Lear</em>? In all this [gestures wildly]? But one thing that myself and so many others were Â able to do while not writing <em>King Lear II</em> was decorate to keep from despairing. âDecoratingâ is maybe too thin a word for what weâre actually doing when weâre moving furniture from here to there or upcycling some sidewalk find or <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/10/diana-ross-its-my-house\" target=\"_blank\">delighting in a new set of shelves and all that lives on them</a>.Â </p>\n<div class=\"callout omfg\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>A hallmark of the last year has been relying on oneâs home to serve all aspects of oneâs life&#8212;social, familial, and work, if one was lucky. Gym, studio, and a place to rest oneâs head, if one were very lucky. Maybe <em>Artists in Residence</em> was such an attractive read right now because it injects urgency and understanding into not just making oneâs home livable, but making it serve oneâs own creativity. The home was felt more starkly important this year than most, and the artists in the book treated it so throughout their lives.Â </p>\n<p>Pandemic-era home makeovers are a natural impulse for a populace staring at the same four walls every day&#8212;a practice in controlling oneâs environment during a chaotic time. Iâve read about this effort to improve <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/should-you-feel-guilty-for-redecorating-during-a-pandemic-11595343916\" target=\"_blank\">functionality</a>, chase <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/5/11/21250834/home-decorating-peel-and-stick-wallpaper-diy-coronavirus-quarantine\" target=\"_blank\">novelty</a>, and to a lesser extent, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/5/11/21250834/home-decorating-peel-and-stick-wallpaper-diy-coronavirus-quarantine\" target=\"_blank\">grab</a> at <a href=\"https://www.houseandgarden.co.uk/article/interiors-and-wellbeing\" target=\"_blank\">control</a> to explain, say, the countryâs <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/why-there-lumber-shortage-us-1526548\" target=\"_blank\">wood shortage</a> or why <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21496101/furniture-resale-market-west-elm-anthropologie-cb2\" target=\"_blank\">everyone is buying a used couch</a>.Â </p>\n<div class=\"callout feature-small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>But what if we could remember a time before, or look to a time after, a time when our home isÂ allowed to be more than that? What if we finally were afforded some time to develop a perspective on the place we spend most of our lives?Â Â </p>\n<p>Lewis, who when we spoke was living with her family in a short-term rental while renovating her Tennessee home, was especially lucky to have done the mental exercise of the book prepandemic and pre-move. She looked especially to HenriÂ Matisse, Louise Bourgeois, and OâKeeffe to conceptualize her new space as an integrated one. âMatisse didn&#39;t, especially in his later life, separate his studio from his house, from his living space,â Lewis told me. âAnd the same with Louise Bourgeois. Her whole home was her studio. And what I am trying to do in our new homeâ¦is to make our whole home a space for creativity, to have, you know, little tabletops here and there where we can all explore, where the kids can bring in things from outside and make an arrangement that&#39;s a work of art or play with things throughout the home, not just in my studio.â</p>\n<div class=\"callout feature-medium\" data-type=\"callout\"><div class=\"callout group-2\" data-type=\"callout\"></div></div><p>Lewis was also struck by how Bourgeois removed her stove from her kitchen. âShe didnât need it, so she just got rid of it. So thinking about things in our homes that we have just because thatâs the way itâs always beenâ and ânot worrying about what other people think and whatâs out there on Instagram that we think we need in our home, just doing it for ourselves and our families and for our visitors.âÂ </p>\n<p>In the end, there is no one good way to make a home, but there are many ways to make a good home.</p>\n<div class=\"callout omfg\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>The pandemic has been a crisis of death and overwhelmed caregivers both inside the hospitals and out, but itâs also a crisis of home. Homelessness and housing insecurity were trenchant problems prior, and despite a ban on evictions, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/20/biden-to-extend-the-national-ban-on-evictions-through-march-2021.html\" target=\"_blank\">which President <strong>Joe Biden</strong> extended to the end of this month</a>, put those already suffering in more precarious situations.

I think especially of the house Diego Rivera built next door, but apart from his own, for Frida Kahlo, and forgetting&#8212;or ignoring&#8212;the need to design it with accessibility. âThe arrangement better suited Rivera. Kahlo didnât like the architectural remove it created between her and her husbandâ and âthe houseâs multiple staircases were painful for her to navigate. She never felt at home there.âÂ Â </p>\n<p>Wyse acknowledged that living situations are in flux (as she knew intimately. When we spoke, she videoconferenced from a hotel down the road from her hospital, having just given birth to her first child.) âIt is hard to make art when you donât have means and when youâre struggling financially,â Wyse said. âItâs distracting and difficult. The myth of a starving artist, as if starvation is somehow helpful to art, is harmful. And I think we need to, as a culture, look at how we can more fully support people in doing this important work.âÂ </p>\n<div class=\"callout omfg\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>But the author also points toward moments where creation happens alongside fluctuating living environments, as with Vincent van Gogh, who spent time in an asylum, and Jean-Michel Basquiat, who essentially crashed with friends until he found success. Hunter, too, had a ârelationship with her home that was very fraught. [Her house] was owned by her employer under very, very problematic circumstances of the Jim Crow South. And it wasnât until she was in her 90s that she was able to buy her first house trailer and her first piece of property in which to park it.â</p>\n<p>As a brand-new mother, sheâs thinking especially about Matisse âas a father and as a grandfather and how deeply loving he was and how fully he included his children and his creative lifeâ¦. They were all a part of his studio. They were all a part of his creative life.âÂ </p>\n<div class=\"callout feature-small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>I havenât accomplished much during my first pandemic. I read a paltry number of books. I didnât manage to paint or draw or write anything more than whatâs required for my work. Â Sorry to <em>King Lear II,</em> may it one day exist. I stayed healthy and pretty much inside, which feels like the most one should be asked to do, and while inside, I started to really make it mine. It doesn&#39;t feed my creativity yet, I donât think, but the work of fixing it up might have stood in for my creativity in the last year. When we begin to go elsewhere in earnest, and get a little distance from this place, mentally and physically, I hope it will become a little of what it was for Bell and Grant or Matisse or Bourgeois or Hajjaj for me and for those I invite into it.Â </p>\n<h3><strong>More Great Stories From</strong> <strong><em>Vanity Fair</em></strong></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Why Kensington Palace Just Canât <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/03/why-kensington-palace-just-cant-let-go-of-meghan-markle?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\">Let Go of Meghan Markle</a><br>\n&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/02/hollywood-portfolio-2021?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\">On With the Show!</a> See the 2021 Hollywood Portfolio<br>\n&#8212; In Conversation: Roxane Gay and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/02/roxane-gay-on-how-to-write-about-trauma?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\">Monica Lewinsky on Trauma</a><br>\n&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/02/reply-all-podcast-pause-resignations?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Reply All</em>âs Implosion</a> Reveals the Limits of One-Sided Internet Relationships<br>\n&#8212; Harry and Meghan Have <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/02/prince-harry-meghan-markle-royal-exit-official?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\">âNo Regretsâ</a> as Royal Exit Becomes Official<br>\n&#8212; Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen on <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/02/bruce-springsteen-barack-obama-podcast-renegades?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\">Their Friendshipâs Origins</a><br>\n&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/video/watch/proust-questionnaire-michael-b-jordan-answers-personality-revealing-questions?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\">Proust Questionnaire</a>: Watch Michael B.

and lawmakers across the aisle are increasingly calling out the Biden administration for a lack of press access at border processing centers, a media blackout preventing reporters from covering what the White House has refused to call a crisis, despite firsthand accounts suggesting otherwise. Immigration detention facilities, overcrowded with unaccompanied children amid the surge of migrants at the southwestern border, are reportedly holding some minors longer than legal 72-hour limit, according to Senator <strong>Shelley Moore Capito</strong>, among the bipartisan group of senators who last week traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border with Homeland Security Secretary <strong>Alejandro Mayorkas</strong>. âIâm very alarmed about the numbers and extremely concerned about the overstay in the facility,â Capito <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/senators-border-minors-press-access/2021/03/20/c4ce50ce-89c2-11eb-8a67-f314e5fcf88d_story.html\">told</a> the <em>Washington Post</em> of a Customs and Border Protection processing center in El Paso, Texas, where she said as many as 100 migrant children who arrived unaccompanied were being held in one large room, raising both policy and public health concerns. âTheyâll move 50 out a night [and] have another 100 come in that night,â the West Virginia Republican said. After 72 hours, CBP facilities are required by law to transfer the unaccompanied children and teens in their custody to the care of Health and Human Services.</p>\n<p>News organizations, however, are struggling to cover what Capito called âheart-rendingâ circumstances and overstay due to limited media access to such government facilities. âWe want to make sure that the press has access to hold the administration accountable,â Senator <strong>Chris Murphy</strong>, another lawmakers who went on the trip, <a href=\"https://www.murphy.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/murphy-gives-firsthand-account-of-border-trip-on-nprs-weekend-edition\">said</a> on NPR Saturday, noting that conditions are âbetter than what we saw in 2019â and ânot kids in so-called cagesâ but nevertheless somewhere âyou wouldnât want your child in for more than 10 minutes,â with kids âsleeping on thin mattresses on the floorâ and spaced âabout six inches to a foot from each other.â During the interview, Murphy said he believes âthereâs a way for DHS to allow some additional press accessâ into the detention centers, where âright now these kids are staying too long.â A day earlier, the Connecticut Democrat shared his immediate reaction to the trip:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1373018632213565443\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1373018632213565443\">https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1373018632213565443</a></p></blockquote></div><p>The lawmakersâ calls echo those of journalists highlighting the lack of media access to the border situation amid the increasing surge of migrants, with the <em>Post</em> on Saturday <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-border-surge/2021/03/20/21824e94-8818-11eb-8a8b-5cf82c3dffe4_story.html\">reporting</a> that more than 10,000 unaccompanied migrant children are currently in the care of DHS and 5,000 more are in CBP custody&#8212;almost twice the previous record. âThe President promised things would be different. Turns out he was right, but in this case not the way we had hoped,â said <strong>Dan Shelley</strong>, the executive director of the Radio Television Digital News Foundation, in a <a href=\"https://www.rtdna.org/article/rtdna_calls_on_secretary_mayorkas_department_of_homeland_security_to_allow_journalists_access_to_board_patrol_facilities_officials\">statement</a> last week, noting that the Trump administration provided the press photos and access to juvenile facilities&#8212;albeit, as NBCâs <strong>Jacob Soboroff</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jacobsoboroff/status/1372617524605423617?s=20\">noted</a>, for the purpose of advertising âthe cruelty of the separation policy. They wanted everyone to see that.â Regardless, Soboroff continued, âNow it&#39;s the Biden administration&#39;s turn to open the doors.â</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/jbmoorephoto/status/1372924066894651392\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbmoorephoto/status/1372924066894651392\">https://twitter.com/jbmoorephoto/status/1372924066894651392</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Despite the administrationâs insistence on being âcommitted to transparency,â as <strong>Jen Psaki</strong>, the White House press secretary, <a href=\"https://view.newsletters.cnn.com/messages/16162086232564fec8af80afe/raw?utm_term=16162086232564fec8af80afe&amp;utm_source=cnn_Reliable+Sources+-+March+19+2021&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=1616208623257&amp;bt_ee=WVCdEmHas%2BgR7OQgNTfQ3GPhrhxgWUbVIVf3WfngjISM%2Fi%2B2QtNOePURJVjT1yk3&amp;bt_ts=1616208623257\">reiterated</a> in a statement to CNNâs <strong>Oliver Darcy</strong> on Friday, its apparent reluctance is drawing <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PamelaBrownCNN/status/1373439482477867010?s=20\">heightened attention</a> to the situation that the White House is already struggling to get under control&#8212;as critics of the president have been quick to capitalize on. âAfter years of bashing the news media, some Republicans and right-wing media outlets have suddenly morphed into press advocates,â Darcy reported, pointing to Senator <strong>Ted Cruz</strong>âs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1372971728993988613?s=20\">tweet</a> calling the lack of press and camera with Mayorkas âoutrageous &amp; unacceptable.â On Thursday evening, Fox Newsâ <strong>Sean Hannity</strong> chimed in. âTheyâre now telling Border Patrol agents, no ride-alongs, any media requests send them to Washington,â he said. âThatâs not transparent. What competent government&#8212;what are they trying to hide?â As the <em>Post</em>âs <strong>Erik Wemple</strong> <a

The concerts bring in an estimated $100 million to the region each year, the AP reported.</p>\n<p>The 2021 season will be roughly half the length it usually is, however, and shows will be truncated with no intermission to about 80 minutes. (Hey, Gustav Mahler, snip a little from the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZgxEXuLFEs\">Symphony No. 3 in D Minor</a> and the BSO may fit you in!) Additionally, all ticketing will be contactless, and mask-wearing and social distancing will be enforced.</p>\n<p>Tanglewood is one of the sacred sites for classical music lovers in North America. Longtime patron Philip Roth set an emotionally resonant scene there in the PEN/Faulkner Award-winning 2000 novel <em>The Human Stain</em>. Conductors and composers associated with the BSO or Tanglewood Music Center include Serge Koussevitzky, Charles MÃ¼nch, Leonard Bernstein, Seiji Ozawa, Leon Fleischer, and James Levine. Jazz, pop, and rock acts play there as well. (The Beach Boys nudged the door open in 1965, then Janis Joplin in 1969.

a wild-seeming rumor raging on Twitter, <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> reached out to director <strong>Chris Columbus</strong> for some clarification. No, of course, not, there was never an NC-17 cut of the 1993 family comedy <em>Mrs. Doubtfire</em>. But there was, however, an R-rated cut.</p>\n<p>The online buzz began late Thursday when a tweet from an account called @factsonfilm stated that &quot;while filming &#39;Mrs. Doubtfire&#39; (1993), Robin Williams improvised so much that there were PG, PG-13, R, and NC-17 cuts of the film.&quot; There was no sourcing for this alleged fact, but it likely comes from an interview with Columbus published in 2015 by <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/directors-reel-chris-columbus-on-adventures-in-124936621212.html\">Yahoo! Movies</a>. The director, whose resume also includes <em>Adventures in Babysitting</em>, <em>Home Alone</em>, and <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone</em>, used some pretty obvious hyperbole when discussing his working relationship with the film&#39;s star.</p>\n<p>Columbus explained that he and Williams, whose mÃ©tier was improvisation, had a deal. They&#39;d get a few scripted takes down, and then Williams would have time to do and say whatever he wanted. For certain setups, they&#39;d have multiple cameras to be sure to capture reactions from other actors who never knew what Williams would say.</p>\n<p>&quot;He would sometimes go into territory that wouldn&#39;t be appropriate for a PG-13 movie, but certainly appropriate and hilariously funny for an R-rated film,&quot; Columbus explained to <em>EW</em>. &quot;I only [previously] used the phrase NC-17 as a joke. There could be no NC-17 version of the movie.&quot;</p>\n<p>There were three cuts of the film one of which was given an R. The version that was released was PG-13.</p>\n<p>Given just how bananas the Internet went over the idea, a &quot;Release The Improv Cut!&quot; movement might gain momentum.

It should inspire many small- to medium-sized businesses, tour operators, taxi drivers, restaurants and retailers to prepare for brighter days ahead, the best we have ever had,&quot; said <strong>The Most Hon.

It would not end like <em>Rocky IV</em>&#8212;I donât think the American would prevail,â Republican representative <strong>Matt Gaetz</strong> told <strong>Sean Hannity</strong> on Thursday.</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1372910156116287490\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1372910156116287490\">https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1372910156116287490</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Hannity, obviously, agreed. âThe question is this,â he said. âWhy would Vladimir Putin immediately call for a debate with Joe Biden with no time to prepare? What have I been saying? What have some of us&#8212;half the American people&#8212;been saying?â (Hannity, of course, has been baselessly claiming Biden is in cognitive decline, which Republicans also swore was the case before the presidential debates, and then had to pivot to claiming Biden was <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/09/donald-trump-joe-biden-drugs\" target=\"_blank\">taking performance-enhancing drugs</a>.) âItâs getting a little scary,â Hannity <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/sean-hannity-biden-cognitive-problems-becoming-worrisome\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> earlier this month. âItâs funny because the media was attacking me for saying that Joe looks weak and he looks frail and heâs struggling cognitively. Well, every day now, pretty much, when he speaks, when heâs allowed to speak, heâs struggling.â In fact, Biden has spoken publicly numerous times since taking office, including a prime-time address.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the presidentâs namesake and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/04/mueller-report-confirms-don-jr-too-stupid-to-collude-with-russia\" target=\"_blank\">arguably dumbest child</a> had this to say:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1372650008844103681\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1372650008844103681\">https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1372650008844103681</a></p></blockquote></div><p>In fact, Putin wanted Juniorâs father in office because he knew just how thoroughly he could manipulate him for reasons that remain unclear (though will perhaps <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/07/10/does-trump-owe-russia-the-supreme-courts-ruling-on-the-presidents-taxes-may-eventually-give-us-answers/\" target=\"_blank\">one day be revealed</a>), and is likely worried about what Biden <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/17/politics/joe-biden-vladimir-putin-price-to-pay/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">has in store for him</a>. Thatâs something he never had to be concerned about when Trump was in office, as his favorite little babushka doll would never even <em>dream</em> of crossing him.Â </p>\n<p><br>\n\\</p>\n<p><strong>Report: The White House is pretty uncool about weed</strong></p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/biden-white-house-sandbags-staffers-sidelines-dozens-for-pot-use\" target=\"_blank\">a report</a> from the Daily Beast, numerous people have been told their ass is grass:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dozens of young White House staffers have been suspended, asked to resign, or placed in a remote work program due to past marijuana use, frustrating staffers who were pleased by initial indications from the Biden administration that recreational use of cannabis would not be immediately disqualifying for would-be personnel, according to three people familiar with the situation. The policy has even affected staffers whose marijuana use was exclusive to one of the 14 states&#8212;and the District of Columbia&#8212;where cannabis is legal.</p>\n<p>In some cases, staffers were informally told by transition higher-ups ahead of formally joining the administration that they would likely overlook some past marijuana use, only to be asked later to resign. âThere were one-on-one calls with individual affected staffers&#8212;rather, ex-staffers,â one former White House staffer affected by the policy told the Daily Beast. âI was asked to resign.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Daily Beast notes that rules about prior marijuana use and their impact on security clearance eligibility vary by agency; for example, at the FBI, an applicant cannot have partaken in the previous three years, while at the NSA, itâs just one. But the White House âlargely calls its own shots.âÂ For example, <strong>Alyssa Mastromonaco,</strong> deputy chief of staff for operations in the Obama administration and a self-described âlove[r] of the ganj,â was allowed to join the administration (though she says she was ârandomly drug-tested pretty much once a month for the first year, and regularly after that.â)</p>\n<p>In response to the report, White House Press Secretary <strong>Jen Psaki</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/1372921409509462018\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted</a> that âof the hundreds of people hired, only five people who had started working at the White House are no longer employed as a result of this policy.â (As the Daily Beast notes, Psaki did not indicate how many people had been disqualified for a White House gig before actually starting.) âI find it absurd that, in 2021, marijuana use is still part of a security clearance background check,â <strong>Tommy Vietor,</strong> an Obama administration veteran, said Thursday. âTo me, marijuana use is completely irrelevant when youâre trying to decide whether an individual should be trusted with national security information.â</p>\n<p><strong>ICYMI: Rep. Lauren Boebert is still all in on QAnon</strong></p>\n<p>The Colorado congresswoman will not sit idly by while <strong>Marjorie Taylor Greene</strong> gets all the press for being the Houseâs resident crazy person. Per the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/boebert-gop-qanon-congress-democrats-b1819868.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Independent</em></a><em>:</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>BoebertÂ has shared aÂ QAnonÂ conspiracy claiming that theÂ GOPÂ will retakeÂ CongressÂ following a supposed wave ofÂ DemocraticÂ resignations and arrestsâ¦. The theory, which would see Republicans gain control the House and Senate before the 2022 elections, has been pushed by the right-wingÂ <em>Epoch Times</em>. Ms. Boebert reportedly told her constituents at the event earlier this week that her sources were close to the ex-president.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>âAnd this is my opinion with that information that I have, I believe we will see resignations begin to take place,â Boebert said, adding that she has âvery good sources that tell me this is very good information. Is it 100 percent? I donât know but itâs very good information.â As a reminder, among other things, QAnon believers <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/02/marjorie-taylor-greene-fake-mea-culpa\" target=\"_blank\">think</a> Democrats are Satan-worshipping pedophiles who eat children.

the past, I have written a lot of essays and political op-eds about racism and sexism, rivers of words arguing for and explaining varieties of the ongoing, abiding fight to get free. This is not what Iâm writing today. On Tuesday, three days ago, a white gunman allegedly shot and killed eight people at three Asian massage parlors in the Atlanta area, including six Asian women, in a racist, sexist attack on massage parlor workers, and today I am not spending any more of my limited time alive defending the humanity of marginalized people, arguing once again with those who donât already see it that we are all fully realized people deserving of human rights. This long, hard week, I have felt especially pulled toward the company of fellow Asian women, so that is who I will write to here.</p>\n<p><em>To</em> Asian women, not for&#8212;thereâs no speaking for us, splendidly vast and manifold as our people are. And my experience of this world, and of America, is that of being a Korean American woman born in Seoul, so let me be specific about the body I inhabit: I moved to the U.S. with my family when I was three years old. I write and teach for a living; Iâve worked in the service industry, at a restaurant, but not since college. It is by no means a given that my life has a lot of overlap with the six Asian women killed while working at massage parlors, even the four women of Korean descent, except that much of America has trouble telling any of us apart.</p>\n<p>It is a standing, pain-riddled joke with close Asian women friends that if we havenât yet been mistaken for each other, weâre not really friends, and my friends laugh, and I laugh, and still they keep mixing us up. To date, I have been mistaken for Asian women who are almost a foot taller than I am, with women 15 years younger or older, biracial people, women who descend from every East Asian and Southeast Asian nation, plus Sri Lanka, as well as India, all of us thrown together by the willful, lazy illogic of racism.</p>\n<p>But I love being in this company&#8212;I love it here, with my sisters. I always have, and thereâs not anywhere else Iâd want to be. With femme-presenting siblings too, though here I hesitate, as I know at least some nonbinary friends prefer not to be categorized with women. It is also true, as many have pointed out, that when it comes to gender-based violence from male strangers, femme-presenting people who arenât women are of course vulnerable, so Iâll write this to you if you want to be here, and not if you donât. And while our siblings of color live with and are killed by white supremacy too, and while our sisters of color and our white sisters live with and are killed by misogyny too, today I have to write to us first, with the Asian women who have been crying all week, who are grief-stricken, furious, afraid, and heartsick, our bodies rioting beneath the heft and bulk of a racist, misogynist tragedy while we <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AAAJ_Atlanta/status/1372641926575427586\">mourn</a>.</p>\n<p>Dear Asian women living in America,</p>\n<p>Until this week, though Iâd often tried, I wasnât able to bring myself to tell my parents to watch out for the <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2021/02/the-us-is-seeing-a-massive-spike-in-anti-asian-hate-crimes.html\">upsurge in anti-Asian attacks</a>, in part because I canât bear it that they moved to this country mostly for my brotherâs and my sake. A lot of you have had this experience too, especially but not at all only during the past year, as weâve seen and heard reports of Asian people being <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/03/10/oakland-robbery-assault-asianamerican-man/\">shoved</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/03/19/san-francisco-asian-attack-arrest/\">punched</a>, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/asian-man-stabbed-back-york-citys-chinatown-suspect/story?id=76133248\">knifed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.q13fox.com/news/man-charged-with-two-random-brutal-attacks-in-seattles-chinatown-international-district\">hit with a sock filled with rocks</a>, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/04/06/brooklyn-woman-burned-outside-home-in-possible-acid-attack/\">disfigured in a possible acid attack</a>, and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/asian-man-stabbed-back-york-citys-chinatown-suspect/story?id=76133248\">killed by strangers</a>, as our elders are attacked and <a href=\"https://abc7news.com/oakland-asian-attack-teaunte-bailey-pak-ho-chesa-boudin/10412069/\">at times killed while theyâre walking down the street</a>, as slurs and hatred are thrown our way by everyone from online harassers to the previous president of this country.</p>\n<p>Lately, every time Iâve heard about, read about, or encountered a fresh incident of hatred, the quiet refrain belling in my head like a chant, or a dirge, is: <em>our hearts are breaking.</em> Iâve found this frustrating, for who does it help, what action is involved in having a breaking heart? Iâm listening more, though, today, to this refrain. Minutes after I first read about the attacks, I started thinking about what I should <em>do,</em> how I could be useful. Maybe I need to take another minute, maybe several minutes, to sit with this breaking heart.</p>\n<p>I will carry for a long time, for instance, the moment I first saw the Korean victimsâ names written in Korean. In hangul, which I associate with joy, with homecoming. With deep, good safety. It is the language written on the books in my parentsâ house, on the menus of restaurants I turn to when I really miss my motherâs food, in the birthday cards my parents send, retelling me the story of my birth in Seoul. This time, the hangul marked the passing of women shot for what they looked like, killed by a racist gunman and by this countryâs white supremacy.</p>\n<p>For a moment, though, I want to go back to that flicker of homecoming. Itâs not just that I love being a Korean woman; I also love that my life is full of Korean women. No one is more intimidating to me than ferocious Korean women, and it is part of my lifeâs work to try to more fully be one of these women. The prospects improve with age, I think. Our mothers are alarming; our grandmothers are terrifying. In my group chats with Korean women, when one of us has been insulted, a conversational leitmotif is that we almost pity the offending person&#8212;who is most often white, a man, or both&#8212;for fucking with us, for not having understood what kind of long-lasting trouble theyâve just heaped upon their own heads.</p>\n<p>I love our care for one another, our devotion, and now Iâm back to talking about Asian women. A powerful urge to care for our people is a blessing, but it can also be a burden, one that has felt especially heavy, perhaps, these past months. One that has made this heartbreak also feel like a kind of failure. Those of us who are immigrants, or the children of immigrants, have from a young age taken on the role of protecting those of our elders whose tongues were shaped in other lands. We grew up interpreting for them, and we put ourselves between them and rude, racist strangers, and we flared up with rage for our elders while they told us not to worry, they were fine.</p>\n<p>As a result, it has perhaps felt all the more brutal that we canât quite protect our own elders. Elders who, in a lot of cases, moved to this country for us. Many of us have also been physically distanced from those we love most by this pandemic, and so it can feel as though weâre failing in this respect too, by not having been able to be there to keep our loves safe from a virus for which they, and we, are being blamed.</p>\n<p>And meanwhile, others are failing us. Have been failing us. The media is buying into and merrily spreading the killerâs lies about his massacre not being racist. They publish his name and print his photo so that, much as I have tried to avoid it&#8212;reading the news with a hand held up to block out his face&#8212;I will carry that image to my grave, as I know many of you will. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/03/17/atlanta-spa-shootings-live-updates/\">Weâre told</a> that the killer couldnât hold out against the âtemptationâ of Asian womenâs bodies. Before we even knew their names, there were assumptions that the killed women were sex workers&#8212;as though that justified the massacre. It does not, and sex work is work; all sex workers deserve the full rights we all should already have. There has still been little reporting on who these women were. Some of you are journalists, and Asian American reporters fluent in the languages some of the murdered women spoke with their families are being told they canât report on the massacre because they <a href=\"https://aaja.org/2021/03/18/aaja-encourages-newsrooms-to-empower-aapi-journalists-and-their-expertise\">might be too biased</a>, although a white journalist&#8212;steeped in this countryâs white supremacy, probably unable to fluently speak with witnesses and family members&#8212;will most likely be especially ill-equipped to tell these stories well and responsibly. One of the first responses from local governments has been to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/19/atlanta-shooting-asian-police-violence\">increase policing in predominantly Asian areas</a>, while many Asian <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AAAJ_Atlanta/status/1372306491231899657\">activists</a> and massage-parlor workers and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Q0mFJnivTZL5fcCS7eUZn9EhOJ1XHtFBGOGqVaUY_8/edit\">sex workers</a> and community leaders have said increased policing will only hurt us, not help us.</p>\n<p>Weâve had to yell so loudly to even get national media and politicians to begin to believe there might be a real problem. I wept, as many of you did, the day last March when the previous president <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/20/coronavirus-trump-chinese-virus/\">started calling it a âChinese virus,â</a> because we knew exactly what would happen as a result, the hatred those paired words would incite. We have been told this is new, that we havenât really experienced racism, all while our entire existence in this country has been twisted, shaped, and contorted by forces like the <a href=\"https://immigrationhistory.org/item/page-act/\">1875 Page Act</a>, which halted the immigration of Chinese women on the stated pretext that they, we, were immoral. Were <em>temptations.</em> All while the Asia&#8211;ravaging forces of white supremacy, imperialism, and colonialism drove our people here, to this land our ancestors would not recognize.</p>\n<p>Some of these failures have come from the people closest to us. So many white friends, family members, colleagues, partners, in-law relatives, and teachers have brushed away, minimized, or entirely ignored our growing alarm. One of the first white men with whom I brought up rising anti-Asian racism replied by asking if this racism was really even happening. I had just told him it was. The silences this week ring loud, in the texts we havenât received, in the absences on social media, as the people who say they deeply love us, who have heard us talk about this, fail to wonder if weâre okay, fail to see if in this time of great collective sorrow it might be a good time to offer us some of that love.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, after the prolonged delay, I finally did talk to my mother, and I asked her to please take extra care when leaving the house. I was trying not to cry, and of course I failed, and of course my mother immediately tried to reassure me. She listed all the reasons she felt okay going to the store&#8212;she had this list ready, sheâd been thinking it through&#8212;and then she started trying to convince me, the one in less danger, not to leave my apartment. If I did leave, she proposed I talk more loudly than usual in English, the hope being that racist white people would know I belonged.</p>\n<p>In other words, sheâd worried about me, and Iâd worried about her, and neither of us had said a word to each other about our long-standing worry because we didnât want to cause each other any additional pain. It hurts. It all hurts. Still and always, hypersexualized, ignored, gaslit, marginalized, and disrespected as weâve been, I am so fortified, so alive, when Iâm with us. And I am thankful to the many other people, especially our Black and brown siblings who live with systemic injustice, unending police violence, and profound marginalization, who know to extend us their love, along with at least some white people. Recently, I was talking with a close friend, the writer <strong>Ingrid Rojas Contreras,</strong> about some of the complications of our lives as women of color, and she said, in a moment that felt like a cloud breaking, like clarity, âWe matter to me.â You matter to me, we matter to me, and I would so much rather have us and our allies on our side than any of them. For we already belong.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><strong>More Great Stories From</strong> <strong><em>Vanity Fair</em></strong></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Why <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/03/meghan-and-harry-revelations-about-racism-within-the-royal-family?itm_content=footer-recirc\">Meghan and Harryâs Revelations About Racism</a> Within the Royal Family Were So Devastating<br>\n&#8212; After <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/03/the-year-of-no-bras-pandemic-anniversary?itm_content=footer-recirc\">the Year of No Bras,</a> Things Are Looking Up<br>\n&#8212; The <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/03/hamptons-donald-trump-jr-and-kimberly-guilfoyle-sold-mansion?itm_content=footer-recirc\">Hamptons Rids Itself of Donald Trump Jr.</a> Ahead of High Season<br>\n&#8212; The New, Sad Irony of <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/03/prince-william-prince-harry-rift?itm_content=footer-recirc\">the Rift Between Prince William and Prince Harry</a><br>\n&#8212; Caroline Rose Giulianiâs Unicorn Tale: <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/03/caroline-giuliani-on-three-way-sex-with-couples?itm_content=footer-recirc\">Three-Way Sex Has Made Me a Better Person</a><br>\n&#8212; A Brief History of <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/03/history-piers-morgan-comments-on-meghan-markle?itm_content=footer-recirc\">Piers Morganâs One-Sided TV Feud</a> With Meghan Markle<br>\n&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2021/03/20-women-owned-fashion-brands-for-celebrating-womens-history-month?itm_content=footer-recirc\">20 Women-Owned Fashion Brands</a> for Celebrating Womenâs History Month<br>\n&#8212; From the Archive: Meghan Markle, <a href=\"https://archive.vanityfair.com/article/2018/5/an-american-princess?itm_content=footer-recirc\">an American Princess</a></p>\n<p>&#8212; Not a subscriber? <a href=\"https://subscribe.vanityfair.com/subscribe/splits/vanityfair/VYF_SELF?source=HCL_VYF_GENERAL_LINK_0\">Join <em>Vanity Fair</em></a> to receive full access to VF.com and the complete online archive now.</p>","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"channels":[{"id":"5ae9f11ff5bec5053bd80396","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Style","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"style"}]},"channel":"Style","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5edc04b0d991ee5f708bd9da","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","email":"","name":"R.O.

But none brought me more joy than a slim book that isnât for the coffee table at all and had no actual photos of spaces, <a href=\"https://www.greenlightbookstore.com/book/9781452179674\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Artists in Residence</em></a><em>,</em> written by <strong>Melissa Wyse</strong> and illustrated by <strong>Kate Lewis</strong></p>\n<p>Lewis renders the homes of 17 artists, from <strong>Hassan Hajjaj</strong> to Georgia OâKeeffe, in bright watercolor, while Wyse describes their relationship to their spaces, especially when it comes to their work. Hajjaj played with the public and private, opening his tearoom in Morocco to visitors as if it were a museum. Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant redefined their shared domesticity with an effort to take interiors seriously, and painted murals or little motifs to highlight a placeâs architecture. Clementine Hunter cocooned her home in patterned wallpaper, putting it not just on the walls but on the ceiling too, giving the area a sense of warmth and color mirrored in her work.Â </p>\n<p>Wyse and Lewisâs book was all set and delivered to the publisher prior to the pandemic, which is a blessing. It contains no hand-wringing over what it all means to be situated in place for a prolonged period of time, and it can live as a piece separate from the pandemic, yet enriched by it.Â </p>\n<p>So leave the hand-wringing to me. This time last year we were thinking, âTwo weeks at home.â If everybody laid low for a mere two weeks, we could snuff the thing out. Just <em>two weeks</em> in our homes. One year later we can laugh to keep from crying at the naÃ¯vetÃ©.</p>\n<div class=\"callout feature-small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>It was also this week last year that somebody <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rosannecash/status/1238700345548627969\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted about Shakespeare writing <em>King Lear</em></a><em>,</em> aÂ sentiment meant to inspire that only depressed. Write <em>King Lear</em>? In all this [gestures wildly]? But one thing that myself and so many others were Â able to do while not writing <em>King Lear II</em> was decorate to keep from despairing. âDecoratingâ is maybe too thin a word for what weâre actually doing when weâre moving furniture from here to there or upcycling some sidewalk find or <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/10/diana-ross-its-my-house\" target=\"_blank\">delighting in a new set of shelves and all that lives on them</a>.Â </p>\n<div class=\"callout omfg\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>A hallmark of the last year has been relying on oneâs home to serve all aspects of oneâs life&#8212;social, familial, and work, if one was lucky. Gym, studio, and a place to rest oneâs head, if one were very lucky. Maybe <em>Artists in Residence</em> was such an attractive read right now because it injects urgency and understanding into not just making oneâs home livable, but making it serve oneâs own creativity. The home was felt more starkly important this year than most, and the artists in the book treated it so throughout their lives.Â </p>\n<p>Pandemic-era home makeovers are a natural impulse for a populace staring at the same four walls every day&#8212;a practice in controlling oneâs environment during a chaotic time. Iâve read about this effort to improve <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/should-you-feel-guilty-for-redecorating-during-a-pandemic-11595343916\" target=\"_blank\">functionality</a>, chase <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/5/11/21250834/home-decorating-peel-and-stick-wallpaper-diy-coronavirus-quarantine\" target=\"_blank\">novelty</a>, and to a lesser extent, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/5/11/21250834/home-decorating-peel-and-stick-wallpaper-diy-coronavirus-quarantine\" target=\"_blank\">grab</a> at <a href=\"https://www.houseandgarden.co.uk/article/interiors-and-wellbeing\" target=\"_blank\">control</a> to explain, say, the countryâs <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/why-there-lumber-shortage-us-1526548\" target=\"_blank\">wood shortage</a> or why <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/21496101/furniture-resale-market-west-elm-anthropologie-cb2\" target=\"_blank\">everyone is buying a used couch</a>.Â </p>\n<div class=\"callout feature-small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>But what if we could remember a time before, or look to a time after, a time when our home isÂ allowed to be more than that? What if we finally were afforded some time to develop a perspective on the place we spend most of our lives?Â Â </p>\n<p>Lewis, who when we spoke was living with her family in a short-term rental while renovating her Tennessee home, was especially lucky to have done the mental exercise of the book prepandemic and pre-move. She looked especially to HenriÂ Matisse, Louise Bourgeois, and OâKeeffe to conceptualize her new space as an integrated one. âMatisse didn&#39;t, especially in his later life, separate his studio from his house, from his living space,â Lewis told me. âAnd the same with Louise Bourgeois. Her whole home was her studio. And what I am trying to do in our new homeâ¦is to make our whole home a space for creativity, to have, you know, little tabletops here and there where we can all explore, where the kids can bring in things from outside and make an arrangement that&#39;s a work of art or play with things throughout the home, not just in my studio.â</p>\n<div class=\"callout feature-medium\" data-type=\"callout\"><div class=\"callout group-2\" data-type=\"callout\"></div></div><p>Lewis was also struck by how Bourgeois removed her stove from her kitchen. âShe didnât need it, so she just got rid of it. So thinking about things in our homes that we have just because thatâs the way itâs always beenâ and ânot worrying about what other people think and whatâs out there on Instagram that we think we need in our home, just doing it for ourselves and our families and for our visitors.âÂ </p>\n<p>In the end, there is no one good way to make a home, but there are many ways to make a good home.</p>\n<div class=\"callout omfg\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>The pandemic has been a crisis of death and overwhelmed caregivers both inside the hospitals and out, but itâs also a crisis of home. Homelessness and housing insecurity were trenchant problems prior, and despite a ban on evictions, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/20/biden-to-extend-the-national-ban-on-evictions-through-march-2021.html\" target=\"_blank\">which President <strong>Joe Biden</strong> extended to the end of this month</a>, put those already suffering in more precarious situations.

I think especially of the house Diego Rivera built next door, but apart from his own, for Frida Kahlo, and forgetting&#8212;or ignoring&#8212;the need to design it with accessibility. âThe arrangement better suited Rivera. Kahlo didnât like the architectural remove it created between her and her husbandâ and âthe houseâs multiple staircases were painful for her to navigate. She never felt at home there.âÂ Â </p>\n<p>Wyse acknowledged that living situations are in flux (as she knew intimately. When we spoke, she videoconferenced from a hotel down the road from her hospital, having just given birth to her first child.) âIt is hard to make art when you donât have means and when youâre struggling financially,â Wyse said. âItâs distracting and difficult. The myth of a starving artist, as if starvation is somehow helpful to art, is harmful. And I think we need to, as a culture, look at how we can more fully support people in doing this important work.âÂ </p>\n<div class=\"callout omfg\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>But the author also points toward moments where creation happens alongside fluctuating living environments, as with Vincent van Gogh, who spent time in an asylum, and Jean-Michel Basquiat, who essentially crashed with friends until he found success. Hunter, too, had a ârelationship with her home that was very fraught. [Her house] was owned by her employer under very, very problematic circumstances of the Jim Crow South. And it wasnât until she was in her 90s that she was able to buy her first house trailer and her first piece of property in which to park it.â</p>\n<p>As a brand-new mother, sheâs thinking especially about Matisse âas a father and as a grandfather and how deeply loving he was and how fully he included his children and his creative lifeâ¦. They were all a part of his studio. They were all a part of his creative life.âÂ </p>\n<div class=\"callout feature-small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>I havenât accomplished much during my first pandemic. I read a paltry number of books. I didnât manage to paint or draw or write anything more than whatâs required for my work. Â Sorry to <em>King Lear II,</em> may it one day exist. I stayed healthy and pretty much inside, which feels like the most one should be asked to do, and while inside, I started to really make it mine. It doesn&#39;t feed my creativity yet, I donât think, but the work of fixing it up might have stood in for my creativity in the last year. When we begin to go elsewhere in earnest, and get a little distance from this place, mentally and physically, I hope it will become a little of what it was for Bell and Grant or Matisse or Bourgeois or Hajjaj for me and for those I invite into it.Â </p>\n<h3><strong>More Great Stories From</strong> <strong><em>Vanity Fair</em></strong></h3>\n<p>&#8212; Why Kensington Palace Just Canât <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/03/why-kensington-palace-just-cant-let-go-of-meghan-markle?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\">Let Go of Meghan Markle</a><br>\n&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/02/hollywood-portfolio-2021?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\">On With the Show!</a> See the 2021 Hollywood Portfolio<br>\n&#8212; In Conversation: Roxane Gay and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/02/roxane-gay-on-how-to-write-about-trauma?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\">Monica Lewinsky on Trauma</a><br>\n&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/02/reply-all-podcast-pause-resignations?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Reply All</em>âs Implosion</a> Reveals the Limits of One-Sided Internet Relationships<br>\n&#8212; Harry and Meghan Have <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/02/prince-harry-meghan-markle-royal-exit-official?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\">âNo Regretsâ</a> as Royal Exit Becomes Official<br>\n&#8212; Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen on <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/02/bruce-springsteen-barack-obama-podcast-renegades?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\">Their Friendshipâs Origins</a><br>\n&#8212; <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/video/watch/proust-questionnaire-michael-b-jordan-answers-personality-revealing-questions?itm_content=footer-recirc\" target=\"_blank\">Proust Questionnaire</a>: Watch Michael B.

From Ho Chi Minh City to the town of Ben Tre, photographer James Nachtwey and the author confront that ecocideâs most shocking legacy&#8212;horrifyingly deformed children&#8212;even as new lawsuits could bring justice for more than a million victims, both Vietnamese and American.","relId":"54cc23f95e7a91c528241e91"},{"hed":"A Flowering Evil","dek":"The shooting of environmentalist Joan Root at her 88-acre farm overlooking Lake Naivasha, last January, shocked Kenyaâs âHappy Valleyâ and the entire conservation world.
