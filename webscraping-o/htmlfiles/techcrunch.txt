But you can stay tolerably up to date on the most interesting developments with this column, which collects AI and machine learning advancements from around the world and explains why they might be important to tech, startups or civilization.<\/p>\n<p>To begin on a lighthearted note: The ways researchers find to apply machine learning to the arts are always interesting \u2014 though not always practical. A team from the University of Washington wanted to see if a computer vision system could learn to tell what is being played on a piano just from an overhead view of the keys and the player&#8217;s hands.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/news\/2021\/02\/04\/audeo-teaches-artificial-intelligence-play-piano\/\">Audeo<\/a>, the system trained by Eli Shlizerman, Kun Su and Xiulong Liu, watches video of piano playing and first extracts a piano-roll-like simple sequence of key presses. Then it adds expression in the form of length and strength of the presses, and lastly polishes it up for input into a MIDI synthesizer for output. The results are a little loose but definitely recognizable.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2115580\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audeo-diagram.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2115580\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2115580\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audeo-diagram.png\" alt=\"Diagram showing how video of a piano player's hands on the keys is turned into MIDI sequences.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"648\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audeo-diagram.png 2015w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audeo-diagram.png?resize=150,95 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audeo-diagram.png?resize=300,190 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audeo-diagram.png?resize=768,486 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audeo-diagram.png?resize=680,430 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audeo-diagram.png?resize=1536,972 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audeo-diagram.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2115580\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Shlizerman, et. al<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To create music that sounds like it could be played in a musical performance was previously believed to be impossible,&#8221; said Shlizerman. &#8220;An algorithm needs to figure out the cues, or &#8216;features,&#8217; in the video frames that are related to generating music, and it needs to &#8216;imagine&#8217; the sound that\u2019s happening in between the video frames. It requires a system that is both precise and imaginative. The fact that we achieved music that sounded pretty good was a surprise.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Another from the field of arts and letters is this extremely fascinating research into <a href=\"https:\/\/news.mit.edu\/2021\/researchers-virtually-open-sealed-historic-letters-0302\">computational unfolding<\/a> of ancient letters too delicate to handle. The MIT team was looking at &#8220;locked&#8221; letters from the 17th century that are so intricately folded and sealed that to remove the letter and flatten it might permanently damage them.

Lindy Fishburne on the seemingly sudden democratization of science"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Deep science investor Lindy Fishburne cofounded the seed- and early-stage venture firm <a href=\"https:\/\/breakout.vc\/\">Breakout Ventures<\/a> several years ago, after cofounding Breakout Labs within the Thiel Foundation back in 2011, and she has amassed a wide array of stakes in the process. Among her firm&#8217;s portfolio companies is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cortexyme.com\/\">Cortexyme<\/a>, a company that aims to treat Alzheimer&#8217;s disease; the sustainable materials maker <a href=\"https:\/\/www.modernmeadow.com\/\">Modern Meadow<\/a>; and <a href=\"https:\/\/strateos.com\/\">Strateos<\/a>, a company whose robotic cloud platform is remaking how lab work gets done.<\/p>\n<p>We talked with Fishburne late this week about where &#8212; based on what she is seeing &#8212; we are in the arc of this pandemic. We also talked about why more of her investments, which once seemed like long shots, suddenly look like solid bets. Parts of our chat, below, have been edited lightly for length and clarity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: We want to be excited about the progress being made in vaccinating Americans. Based on the conversations you&#8217;re having, what&#8217;s your sense of things?<\/strong><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>LF: The acceleration of the vaccines is like nothing we&#8217;ve ever seen before in science, and now we really are down to the unsexy part of of the logistics of rolling them out. That&#8217;s clearly our biggest challenge. Then the next piece we&#8217;re going to have to confront is what happens when the world is vaccinated [at] very unequal levels and how people feel about travel and exposure and equity along those issues.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Science has been the big story of the last year. Are you hearing from investors and potential syndicate partners who weren&#8217;t reaching out previously?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>LF: Yes. The pandemic has brought the importance of investing in science into sharp relief. For the first time, we&#8217;re really seeing a whole set of what you would think of as traditional tech investors who read about the mRNA vaccine that Moderna coded in a weekend and who are starting to believe that we&#8217;re able to engineer biology and that it doesn&#8217;t feel like a craft process anymore.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: You talk about coding a vaccine. Are laboratories becoming less important in that scientists are able to do much more in simulation and, if so, what does that mean for human testing? Are we getting to a point where we don&#8217;t have to rely on human testing as much as we did in the past?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>LF: That&#8217;s where we <em>hope<\/em> to get on the human testing piece. We&#8217;re not there yet. You may have read and heard about organs on a chip and growing organoids, where you can have a very small piece of liver that you&#8217;re able to test toxicity on [and] we&#8217;re doing more of that. That said, we&#8217;re not ready to make that leap from completely doing it in silico to humans with a super-high level of confidence.The human body is such a complex system that we&#8217;re not able to model that fully yet.<\/p>\n<p>I do think what you&#8217;re pointing toward to some degree is democratization in science and the access for more people to be able with lower skills to be able to work in drug discovery and drug development at a distance. So for example, we have a company that we&#8217;ve worked with called Strateos that has a full robotic lab that &#8212; instead of having technicians standing there &#8212; you have robots and a little train track that moves assays throughout the room so that scientists who were stuck at home this year were able to continue experiments regardless of their geography or safety in the lab or time constraints.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: You have another interesting portfolio company, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.opus-12.com\/\">Opus 12<\/a>, which is transforming industrial carbon dioxide emissions into chemicals. Toward what end?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>LF: So obviously, decarbonizing the world is a huge focus. And you&#8217;re seeing for the first time corporations like United Airlines making commitments as to what their carbon footprint will be, or going to zero carbon emissions. Opus 12 emerged from two PhDs and an MBA out of Stanford a few years ago and their breakthrough is a catalyst material that allows you to take for example, waste CO2 &#8212; the bad stuff &#8212; and run it through this catalyst material and produce useful CO. This year, for example, they produced green polycarbonate car parts in partnership with Daimler. The material is exactly the same, which makes it easy to slot into existing products, but it&#8217;s actually made by reusing carbon.<\/p>\n<p>The shift in consumer awareness around carbon made materials is an enormous opportunity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Do companies get some sort of carbon credit for doing that?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>LF: Yes, and in the past what we&#8217;ve seen is a lot of companies trying to green themselves by basically buying and trading carbon credits, and the shift that we&#8217;re going through right now is everyone saying, &#8216;Okay, to some degree, that was a bit of financial engineering; now we actually need to see these businesses making a change in their direct use of fossil fuels and their direct impact in the amount of carbon.&#8217; [There&#8217;s growing awareness that] buying carbon offsets isn&#8217;t going to be enough. So you&#8217;re now for the first time really seeing commitments to change processes, supply chain and ultimately products.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: In recent years, biotech companies have been going public two and three years after being formed. Now, we&#8217;re seeing a much wider array of younger companies being transformed into public companies through a growing number of blank-check companies. Any thoughts about whether or not there are parallels here?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>LF: On the therapeutic side, you tend to have a very clear playbook around what the potential exit is and who the acquirers are. We know that big pharma is cash rich and pipeline poor, and so [these pharma giants] have to pick up the assets that are working, and you see them do that regularly. And you&#8217;ve got comps, and you know what that looks like,\u00a0 so in placing a wide range of bets on early-stage therapeutics, it&#8217;s clear that if one wins, you&#8217;re covered.<\/p>\n<p>The SPAC world is going to be really interesting because most of these companies are not operating off traditional playbooks, and it&#8217;s not clear whether they operate as public companies longer term. Are they really set up for acquisition?<\/p>\n<p>[Another] difference here is these companies are going to have this enormous amount of funding, and yet they&#8217;re not going to be able to toil in obscurity, so the traditional metrics that we all want [in] public companies and looking at revenue and profits and those metrics, we&#8217;re going to have to look at these SPACs and their growth through a different lens, and I&#8217;m just not sure how receptive the public markets will be to that in the next 24 months.

On Friday, we <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/05\/understanding-how-investors-value-growth-in-2021\/\">took a look<\/a> into why that was the case, and where the valuations could be a bit more bubbly than others. Per <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/document\/497410287\/Battery-Ventures-Software-2021-Report\">a report<\/a> written by few Battery Ventures investors, it stands to reason that the middle of the SaaS market could be where valuation inflation is at its peak.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Something to keep in mind if your startup\u2019s growth rate is ticking lower. But today, instead of being an enormous bummer and making you worry, I have come with some historically notable data to show you how good modern software startups and their larger brethren have it today.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2121929 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-05-at-1.15.20-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"889\" height=\"204\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-05-at-1.15.20-PM.png 889w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-05-at-1.15.20-PM.png?resize=150,34 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-05-at-1.15.20-PM.png?resize=300,69 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-05-at-1.15.20-PM.png?resize=768,176 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-05-at-1.15.20-PM.png?resize=680,156 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-05-at-1.15.20-PM.png?resize=50,11 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 889px) 100vw, 889px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In case you are not 100% infatuated with tables, let me save you some time. In the upper right we can see that SaaS companies today that are growing at less than 10% yearly are trading for an average of 6.9x their next 12 months\u2019 revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Back in 2011, SaaS companies that were growing at 40% or more were trading at 6.0x their next 12 month\u2019s revenue. Climate change, but for software valuations.<\/p>\n<p>One more note from my chat with Battery. Its investor Brandon Gleklen riffed with The Exchange on the definition of ARR and its nuances in the modern market. As more SaaS companies swap traditional software-as-a-service pricing for its consumption-based equivalent, he declined to quibble on definitions of ARR, instead arguing that all that matters in software revenues is whether they are being retained and growing over the long term. This brings us to our next topic.<\/p>\n<h2>Consumption v. SaaS pricing<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve taken a number of earnings calls in the last few weeks with public software companies. One theme that\u2019s come up time and again has been consumption pricing versus more traditional SaaS pricing. There is some data showing that consumption-priced software companies are <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/18\/why-do-saas-companies-with-usage-based-pricing-grow-faster\/\">trading at higher multiples<\/a> than traditionally priced software companies, thanks to better-than-average retention numbers.<\/p>\n<p>But there is more to the story than just that. Chatting with Fastly CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/joshuabixby?lang=en\">Joshua Bixby<\/a> after his company&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/investors.fastly.com\/files\/doc_financials\/2020\/q4\/4Q20-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\">earnings report<\/a>, we picked up an interesting and important market distinction between where consumption may be more attractive and where it may not be. Per Bixby, Fastly is seeing larger customers prefer consumption-based pricing because they can afford variability and prefer to have their bills tied more closely to revenue. Smaller customers, however, Bixby said, prefer SaaS billing because it has rock-solid predictability.<\/p>\n<p>I brought the argument to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/poyark?lang=en\">Open View Partners Kyle Poyar<\/a>, a venture denizen who has been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/29\/subscription-based-pricing-is-dead-smart-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-models\/\">writing on this topic for TechCrunch<\/a> in recent weeks. He noted that in some cases the opposite can be true, that variably priced offerings can appeal to smaller companies because their developers can often test the product without making a large commitment.<\/p>\n<p>So, perhaps we\u2019re seeing the software market favoring SaaS pricing among smaller customers when they are certain of their need, and choosing consumption pricing when they want to experiment first. And larger companies, when their spend is tied to equivalent revenue changes, bias toward consumption pricing as well.<\/p>\n<p>Evolution in SaaS pricing will be slow, and never complete. But folks really are thinking about it. Appian CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/mattcalkins\/\">Matt Calkins<\/a> has a general pricing thesis that price should \u201chover\u201d under value delivered. Asked about the consumption-versus-SaaS topic, he was a bit coy, but did note that he was not \u201centirely happy\u201d with how pricing is executed today. He wants pricing that is a \u201cbetter proxy for customer value,\u201d though he declined to share much more.<\/p>\n<p>If you aren\u2019t thinking about this conversation and you run a startup, what&#8217;s up with that? More to come on this topic, including notes from an interview with the CEO of BigCommerce, who is betting on SaaS over the more consumption-driven Shopify.<\/p>\n<h2>Next Insurance, and its changing market<\/h2>\n<p>Next Insurance <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nextinsurance.com\/blog\/next-insurance-acquisition-ap-intego\/\">bought<\/a> another company this week. This time it was AP Intego, which will bring integration into various payroll providers for the digital-first SMB insurance provider. Next Insurance should be familiar because TechCrunch has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/10\/as-next-insurance-makes-its-first-acquisition-insurtech-looks-energetic\/\">written about its growth a few times<\/a>. The company doubled its premium run rate to $200 million in 2020, for example.<\/p>\n<p>The AP Intego deal brings $185.1 million of active premium to Next Insurance, which means that the neo-insurance provider has grown sharply thus far in 2021, even without counting its organic expansion. But while the Next Insurance deal and the <a href=\"https:\/\/hippo-static.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/investors\/Hippo+Reinvent+Presentation+March+2021+(vF+Announced).pdf\">impending Hippo SPAC<\/a> are neat notes from a hot private sector, insurtech has shed some of its public-market heat.<\/p>\n<p>Stocks of public neo-insurance companies like Root, Lemonade and MetroMile have <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/05\/the-technology-selloff-is-getting-to-be-somewhat-material\/\">lost quite a lot of value in recent weeks<\/a>. So, the exit landscape for companies like Next and Hippo &#8212; yet-private insurtech startups with lots of capital backing their rapid premium growth &#8212; is changing for the worse.<\/p>\n<p>Hippo decided it will debut via a SPAC. But I doubt that Next Insurance will pursue a rapid ramp to the public markets until things smooth out. Not that it needs to go public quickly; it raised a quarter billion back in September of last year.<\/p>\n<h2>Various and Sundry<\/h2>\n<p>What else?

Kong fintech unicorn WeLab raises $75M led by insurance giant Allianz"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">One of the few industries that have benefited from the COVID-19 crisis is online finance. Around the world, the pandemic has forced consumers to adopt digital banking. Hong Kong&#8217;s WeLab, a fintech company founded in 2013, saw users soar by 20% year-over-year in 2020, bringing its accumulative user base to 50 million.<\/p>\n<p>Facing innovative players like WeLab, which aims to bring more convenience, transparency, and affordability to consumers, financial incumbents feel compelled to reinvent themselves. That&#8217;s in part why <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/20\/allianz-x-1-billion-eur\/\">Allianz X<\/a>, a venture capital arm of the 131-year-old European financial conglomerate Allianz, led WeLab&#8217;s latest funding round of $75 million. The Series C1, which involved other investors, followed WeLab&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/welab-raises-us156m-in-series-c-strategic-financing-completing-the-largest-fintech-fundraising-in-greater-china-in-2019-300973821.html\">$156 million Series C round<\/a> in late 2019.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Obviously, Allianz is one of the largest asset managers and insurers in the world with a strong presence and solid footprint,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Simon Loong told TechCrunch during an interview.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Loong declined to disclose WeLab&#8217;s latest valuation but said the number has gone up since the firm last reached the $1 billion unicorn status.<\/p>\n<p>When WeLab set out to build a digital bank, which launched in Hong Kong last year, one of the products it had in mind was &#8220;a new generation of wealth advisory on digital banks.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Allianz saw what we did over the last couple of years and identified this very interesting opportunity to co-develop a wealth technology for digital banks, so they came to us and said, why don&#8217;t they lead the round?&#8221; Loong explained.<\/p>\n<p>Through the strategic investment, the partners will jointly develop and distribute investment and insurance solutions across Asia. Those products will diversify Welab&#8217;s current offerings, including a virtual bank and a lending product in Hong Kong, as well as several types of lending services in mainland China and Indonesia. Around 47 million of its total users are in mainland China, 2.5 million in Indonesia, and less than one million in Hong Kong, a city with a 7.5 million population.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an interesting four-way cooperation,&#8221; said Loong, referring to the roles of Allianz as an asset management and insurance firm, and WeLab as a bank and fintech solution provider. &#8220;I think it will really be an interesting inflection point for the company to scale.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>Working with titans<\/h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2122158\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2122158\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2122158\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/WeLab-Team-Photo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"749\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/WeLab-Team-Photo.jpg 6706w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/WeLab-Team-Photo.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/WeLab-Team-Photo.jpg?resize=300,220 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/WeLab-Team-Photo.jpg?resize=768,562 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/WeLab-Team-Photo.jpg?resize=680,498 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/WeLab-Team-Photo.jpg?resize=1536,1124 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/WeLab-Team-Photo.jpg?resize=2048,1499 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/WeLab-Team-Photo.jpg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2122158\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The WeLab team<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Equally important to WeLab&#8217;s revenue is enterprise services, according to Loong, which are helping conventional banks and financial institutions build up a digital presence. The strategy is not unlike Ant Group&#8217;s effort to be an &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.techinasia.com\/ant-financial-wants-to-be-tech-company\">enabler<\/a>&#8221; for traditional financial players.<\/p>\n<p>In spite of the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/11\/09\/tencent-vs-alibaba-ant-fintech\/\">massive combined market share<\/a> of Ant and Tencent in China&#8217;s fintech market, there remains room for smaller and more specialized players like WeLab. To date, WeLab has attracted about 600 enterprise customers, most of whom are in mainland China.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;[We have] an interesting dynamics with Ant,&#8221; said Loong, when asked how WeLab wrestles with a goliath like Ant, whose e-commerce affiliate Alibaba is an investor in WeLab through the Alibaba Hong Kong Entrepreneurs Fund.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There are businesses where we compete, and there are also areas where we work well together,&#8221; he added. For example, WeLab introduced one of the first smartphone leasing services on Alipay, Ant&#8217;s flagship app that works as a marketplace for third-party financial products and end consumers. But Ant also has its own in-house financial products, which could clash with outside suppliers peddling on its marketplace.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In short, I would say that because we are a rather independent company, we work with everyone,&#8221; Loong asserted.<\/p>\n<h2>Greater Bay links<\/h2>\n<p>As a Hong Kong-founded firm, WeLab has actively taken part in the Chinese government&#8217;s push to integrate what&#8217;s dubbed the Greater Bay Area, which spans the two special administrative regions of China, Hong Kong and Macau, and nine cities in the southern province of Guangdong, including Shenzhen.<\/p>\n<p>An objective of the GBA blueprint is to encourage cross-border talent flow. In a way, the area has all the right conditions to run a fintech startup, which would gain access to technological and banking talents respectively in Shenzhen and Hong Kong, two adjoining cities. WeLab has done exactly that, with a larger base of tech staff in Shenzhen compared to its Hong Kong office which has more finance professionals. <span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">It&#8217;s planning to add around 100 hires this year to its 800-person headcount.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Aside from shared talent pools, Beijing also wants to encourage more financial integration in the GBA. WeLab has taken notice and plans to roll out its forthcoming wealth management products first in Hong Kong and later into other parts of the GBA through the government-supported scheme called the <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.deloitte.com\/cn\/en\/pages\/financial-services\/articles\/wealth-management-connect-in-the-gba.html\">Wealth Management Connect<\/a>, which allows residents of Hong Kong and Macau to invest in wealth management products distributed by mainland banks in the GBA. Vice versa, residents in the mainland GBA cities will be able to buy wealth management products in Hong Kong and Macau.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Hong Kong is a great testbed, but for online business, you need to subject your successful business model to a large population,&#8221; said Loong, explaining the company&#8217;s expansion plan. &#8220;The Greater Bay Area gives us the opportunity to do so. There is a 72 million population with a GDP of $1.7 trillion, which is larger than South Korea&#8230; Naturally, it is a good area to scale.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>WeLab was looking to go public back in 2018 but halted the plan because &#8220;we didn&#8217;t feel that it was the right market window to do this,&#8221; Loong recalled. The company was also in the process of securing a banking license, so it decided to work on the critical permit before going public.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Obviously if you look now, it&#8217;s very hot in terms of the equity market,&#8221; said Loong. &#8220;So we are talking to a lot of people. We keep a close eye on this and we are always open-minded to explore the next right market window for us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the few industries that have benefited from the COVID-19 crisis is online finance.

It makes sense. The thing about smartphones in 2021 is that they\u2019re mostly very good. Sure, there are differentiators, but if you spend a decent amount on a device from any major manufacturer, you\u2019re probably going to get a pretty good device.<\/p>\n<p>But there\u2019s still plenty of opportunity to continually bridge the gap between smartphone imaging and devoted camera systems. And today OnePlus takes a potentially key step in that direction by announcing a partnership with Hasselblad. The DJI-owned Swedish camera maker has signed onto a three-year partnership with OnePlus.<\/p>\n<p>According to a release tied to the news, the pair plan to spend $150 million over the course of the deal, in an attempt to vault OnePlus to the front of the pack. Hasselblad has dipped its toes in the mobile market, including a Moto Z attachment, and has created cameras for DJI drones, but this represents a pretty big move for the 180-year-old camera company.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The first fruits of the partnership will arrive on the OnePlus 9, a new handset set to launch on March 23. The companies promise a \u201crevamped camera system.\u201d The phone will feature a Sony IMX789 sensor, coupled with HDR video and the ability capture 4K at 120FPS and 8K at 30FPS.<\/p>\n<p>Per the release:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The partnership will continuously develop over the next three years, starting with software improvements including color tuning and sensor calibration, and extending to more dimensions in the future. The two parties will jointly define the technology standards of the mobile camera experience and develop innovative imaging technologies, continuing to improve the Hasselblad Camera for Mobile. Both companies are committed to delivering immediate benefit for OnePlus users, while continuously collaborating to further improve the user experience and quality for the long-term.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The deal includes the development of four global labs, including U.S. and Japan locations and:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Pioneering new areas of smartphone imaging technology for future OnePlus camera systems, such as a panoramic camera with a 140-degree field of view, T-lens technology for lightning-fast focus in the front-facing camera, and a freeform lens \u2013 to be first introduced on the OnePlus 9 Series \u2013 that practically eliminates edge distortion in ultrawide photos.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how a company like Hasselblad will take to mobile imaging, though such a deal could be a secret weapon as OnePlus looks to keep on the flagship end of the mobile spectrum against the likes of Apple and Samsung.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"S5my2QMlpp\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/28\/will-apples-spectacular-iphone-12-sales-figures-boost-the-smartphone-industry-in-2021\/\">Will Apple&#8217;s spectacular iPhone 12 sales figures boost the smartphone industry in 2021?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Will Apple&#8217;s spectacular iPhone 12 sales figures boost the smartphone industry in 2021?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/28\/will-apples-spectacular-iphone-12-sales-figures-boost-the-smartphone-industry-in-2021\/embed\/#?secret=S5my2QMlpp\" data-secret=\"S5my2QMlpp\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"colxHuB8Fx\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/23\/onepluss-8t-handset-brings-faster-charging-and-a-120hz-display-for-749\/\">OnePlus\u2019s 8T handset brings faster charging and a 120Hz display for\u00a0$749\u00a0<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;OnePlus\u2019s 8T handset brings faster charging and a 120Hz display for\u00a0$749\u00a0&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/23\/onepluss-8t-handset-brings-faster-charging-and-a-120hz-display-for-749\/embed\/#?secret=colxHuB8Fx\" data-secret=\"colxHuB8Fx\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Imaging has long been the primary battlefield on which the smartphone battles are waged.

women\u00a0have access to economic equality, opportunity to build financial independence and pursue entrepreneurism, said Google chief executive Sundar Pichai at a virtual event.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Whatever these teams need, we are going to be alongside them and help carry out their vision,&#8221; said Jacquelline Fuller, President of Google.org, at the event. The company said it will accept applications from teams worldwide until April 9.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Fuller also announced that Google.org is going to invest an additional $1 million to help underserved women in India. Even as India is the world&#8217;s second largest internet market, women make up a small percentage of online users in the country.<\/p>\n<p>Five years ago, Google launched a program called <a href=\"https:\/\/internetsaathiindia.org\/\">Internet Saathi<\/a> to bring internet literacy to women in rural parts of India. The company said the program, for which it collaborated with Indian conglomerate Tata, significantly helped improve women&#8217;s participation on Indian internet.<\/p>\n<p>Four of 10 internet users in rural India are now women, said Google, up from one in 10 in 2015.\u00a0The company, citing its own research, said Internet Saathi program benefited more than 30 million women in India &#8212; and that it&#8217;s now concluding the program to focus on other efforts to continue this mission.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis program created a cascading effect,\u201d said Sanjay Gupta, the head of Google India, at the event.<\/p>\n<p>But simply getting online &#8220;isn&#8217;t progress enough,&#8221; said Sapna Chadha, Senior Marketing Director for Google in India and Southeast Asia. &#8220;Women in India have traditionally been held back from economic participation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The company has partnered with Nasscom Foundation, the social arm of influential Indian trade group, to bring digital and financial literacy to 100,000 women farmers in India, and is creating a program called &#8220;Women Will&#8221; to enable and support 1 million women entrepreneurs.<\/p>\n<p>As part of Women Will program, Chadha unveiled a <a href=\"http:\/\/g.co\/skillingindia\">repository website<\/a> that she said will feature tutorials, business ideas and other opportunities in English and Hindi languages.<\/p>\n<p>Google is also working on rolling out a new feature on Google Pay app that will allow entrepreneurs to showcase their business pages within the payments app at no charge, said Chadha. And women entrepreneurs can now choose to highlight that their business is led by a woman or women across Google Search and Google Maps listings, Chadha said.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I call upon you to come together to build a future we can all be proud of &#8212; a future where no daughter of ours is shackled by the burdens of her gender,&#8221; said Smriti Irani, Minister of Women and Child Development, Government of India, at the event.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google announced a range of programs as well as grants worth $25 million on Monday to fund works of nonprofits and social enterprises that are committed to empower women and girls.

But in recent years, as smartphones became to offer built-in filters, photo editors like Meitu are struggling to hold their lead. Meitu&#8217;s stock shrank from HK$18 apiece in 2017 to less than HK$3 today.<\/p>\n<p>As the company turns 13 years old and seeks alternative growth, it sets its eyes on cryptocurrency.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Meitu purchased 15,000 units of Ether and 379.1214267 units of Bitcoin worth around $22.1 million and $17.9 million respectively on March 5 in open market transactions, the company <a href=\"https:\/\/corp-static.meitu.com\/corp-new\/92016878a68bac4ad8121e906eae6687_1615115628.pdf\">disclosed <\/a>Sunday. The purchase is the first tranche of the firm&#8217;s investment plan to buy up to $100 million worth of cryptocurrency, which is financed by its cash reserves.<\/p>\n<p>In recent times, Meitu chairman Cai Wensheng has been an outspoken <a href=\"https:\/\/weibo.com\/1729853157\/GeXMxjpF4?from=page_1003061729853157_profile&amp;wvr=6&amp;mod=weibotime\">advocate of blockchain technologies<\/a>. Though China has banned initial coin offerings and crypto trading exchanges, Cai said in 2018 that he personally <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/chinese-angel-investor-amassed-10000-bitcoins-amid-q1-price-slump\">bought about 10,000 bitcoins<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>His support for cryptocurrencies is manifested in Meitu&#8217;s latest investment move. In the disclosure, the company states:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Board takes the view that blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt both existing financial and technology industries, similar to the manner in which mobile internet has disrupted the PC internet and many other offline industries. The Board believes that the blockchain industry is still in its early stage, analogous to the mobile internet industry in circa 2005.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It continues: &#8220;Against this backdrop, the Board believes cryptocurrencies have ample room for appreciation in value and by allocating part of its treasury in cryptocurrencies can also serve as a diversification to holding cash treasury management.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Meitu further explains that the Bitcoin investment is part of its &#8220;asset allocation&#8221; plan while its bet on Ether will aid its general blockchain endeavor, wherein it&#8217;s considering baking blockchain into its various overseas businesses, including Ethereum-based dApps. It&#8217;s also looking to invest in overseas blockchain projects &#8220;that can be synergistic to its large user base.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/corp-static.meitu.com\/corp-new\/a4f85272b958835d2079f0895f3c22df_1598524316.pdf\">As of June 2020<\/a>, Meitu claimed nearly 300 million monthly active users on its suite of apps released across the globe.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"nA1LunuCvw\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/03\/bsn-china-national-blockchain\/\">China&#8217;s national blockchain network embraces global developers<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;China&#8217;s national blockchain network embraces global developers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/03\/bsn-china-national-blockchain\/embed\/#?secret=nA1LunuCvw\" data-secret=\"nA1LunuCvw\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n<p><audio style=\"display: none;\" controls=\"controls\"><\/audio><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Following in the footsteps of Tesla, Chinese app maker Meitu has joined the ranks of cryptocurrency investment.

foreign policy advisor to Barack Obama&#8217;s 2008 presidential campaign and working for the World Bank in Afghanistan. While visiting Bangladesh in 2011 for a family wedding, however, Sinha had a &#8220;lightbulb moment&#8221; after her mother nearly died after an operation at a top private hospital.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When I had this experience with my mom, I observed that there was really no amount of money that could afford you access to quality healthcare in Bangladesh,&#8221; she told TechCrunch.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;It really struck me that despite all the progress the country had made, and the fact that there is now a middle class of 40 million people, that there are still not really great options for excellent healthcare,&#8221; she added. &#8220;You have thousands of people traveling abroad every day and billions of dollars a year going outside the country to access better healthcare.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Born and raised in the United States, Sinha moved to Bangladesh in 2015 to start working on Praava. Today the company is announcing a Series A Prime round that brings its total raised to $10.6 million. Praava claims to have tripled its growth every year since launching services in 2018, and now serves 150,000 patients. In 2020, it also processed 75,000 COVID-19 tests in-house.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2122061\" style=\"width: 460px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/patient-portal.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2122061\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2122061\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/patient-portal.jpg\" alt=\"Praava Health's patient portal app\" width=\"450\" height=\"498\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/patient-portal.jpg 1175w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/patient-portal.jpg?resize=135,150 135w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/patient-portal.jpg?resize=271,300 271w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/patient-portal.jpg?resize=768,850 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/patient-portal.jpg?resize=614,680 614w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/patient-portal.jpg?resize=45,50 45w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2122061\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Praava Health&#8217;s patient portal app<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Praava&#8217;s backers include a list of prominent angel investors: retired United States Army General David H.

Praava plans to open more clinics in Dhaka, before expanding into Chittagong, the country\u2019s second-largest city.<\/p>\n<p>Its &#8220;brick-and-click&#8221; model, including online consultations, also allows it to reach patients throughout the country. Virtual healthcare accounts for about 40% of Praava\u2019s services including telemedicine and an online pharmacy.<\/p>\n<p>Bangladesh is one of the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cfr.org\/blog\/reach-its-economic-dreams-bangladesh-needs-rethink-healthcare\"> fastest-growing economies in the world<\/a>, but there is a critical shortage of healthcare workers for its 170 million people. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/workforcealliance\/countries\/bgd\/en\/\">World Health Organization estimates<\/a> that there are only about 3 physicians and 1 nurse for every 10,000 people, and most work in urban hospitals, even though 70% of Bangladesh\u2019s population is in rural areas. This means people often travel long distances for consultations that may last less than a minute.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"moyv8He6IN\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/08\/bangladesh-based-maya-a-startup-focused-on-accessible-healthcare-raises-2-2-million-seed-round\/\">Maya, a startup focused on accessible healthcare in Asia, raises $2.2 million seed for regional expansion<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Maya, a startup focused on accessible healthcare in Asia, raises $2.2 million seed for regional expansion&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/08\/bangladesh-based-maya-a-startup-focused-on-accessible-healthcare-raises-2-2-million-seed-round\/embed\/#?secret=moyv8He6IN\" data-secret=\"moyv8He6IN\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;One of the things that we see telemedicine really help with is patients outside of Dhaka to figure out if they even need to make that trip,&#8221; said Sinha.<\/p>\n<p>The company found that in over 80% of cases, especially primary care, its providers are able to address patient needs online. In the remaining 20% of cases, they will ask them to come into one of Praava\u2019s clinics, which provide a wide range of outpatient services, imaging and lab diagnostics and a pharmacy.<\/p>\n<p>At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, about 90% of Praava&#8217;s consultations were happening virtually, though clinic visits have picked up again. Most of Praava&#8217;s doctors are salaried full-time employees and one of its goals is to create deeper provider-patient relationships, with appointments typically lasting about 15 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I think technology is the future of health, there\u2019s absolutely no doubt about that,&#8221; Sinha said. &#8220;But when it come to seeing a doctor and the kind of healthcare needs that we all have over the course of our lifetime, technology is not going to be able to replace that entirely.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Most of Praava&#8217;s patients currently pay per visit, and its pricing is at market rate, between Bangladesh&#8217;s public healthcare system and more expensive private hospitals.

It is an engaging platform, somewhat clunky in feature set but easily a tie overall with Clubhouse. I don&#8217;t see this as a horse race, however, more as cooperating teams fleshing out a platform where both will be major players. Like notifications in iOS and Android, the feature set is a push and pull motion where Android delivers deep functionality and Apple alternately pulls ahead and consolidates gains. Though the details can vary, the combined energy of effectively 100 percent of the consumer base mandates best practices and opportunities for innovation.<\/p>\n<p>Something similar is going on in Washington as the Democrats test out their majority of none on the pandemic stimulus bill. The headline in the Times says bipartisanship is dead, but the subheading is the real story. The battle for control of the Senate is closing in on the arcane gerrymandering of the filibuster, or what passes for it after Republican whittling of the original talk &#8217;til you drop croaking of Jimmy Stewart as in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The telltale giveaway is Senator Lindsay Graham, who complains bitterly that the Democrats are steamrolling the COVID Rescue Bill without Republican votes &#8220;because they can.&#8221; The actual bipartisanship is between the progressives and moderates in the Democratic Party, as the Senator from West Virginia moderates one aspect of the bill to gain the prize of something the President can sign. Not only does it establish Biden&#8217;s power to govern but it also provides a roadmap for justifying the necessity of altering the filibuster equation.<\/p>\n<p>Notice how Biden changed the subject from bipartisan negotiations to the power play it turned into. He used the polls to squeeze the Republican moderates where they fear most, the primary battles for control of the House in the midterms. The wave of vaccines are making it almost impossible to put up a political firewall; the anti-mask mandates seem like clueless floundering as people begin to have hope of an exit from the gridlock of partisan obstructionism. It will be hard to run on a platform of denial and death as we reach the end of May.<\/p>\n<p>Governing by success undercuts the argument that government doesn&#8217;t work. Breaking the back of the filibuster requires the framing of the issue as finding a way to let government keep working in a bipartisan way. That brings us back to changing the definition of bipartisan as evidenced in the technology arena. In the Apple\/Android example, two viable entities bring different strengths to insuring the ability to survive long enough to govern. Google&#8217;s lock on the network effect in advertising and &#8220;free&#8221; services may be challenged by Apple&#8217;s focus on privacy and a hardware revenue base, but the net effect is to cancel each other&#8217;s vulnerabilities due to the market force of their positions. The bipartisan finesse is that each platform has the other as a dominant customer.<\/p>\n<p>In the same vein, Twitter v. Clubhouse is really not the point. Certainly we can cherrypick the battle as startup v. incumbent: Clubhouse filled with unicorn celebrities and rockstar investors and a builtin tension with the media, Twitter protectively fast following with its natural social graph advantages and struggling with scalability and the fear they&#8217;ve sown of abandoning projects before they can thrive. The question begged: what is the nature of the bipartisan compromise that will ensure both end up winners?<\/p>\n<p>The answer is how to make each player the best customer of the other. Twitter&#8217;s problem is focus, and harnessing the power of users to hack the system to both theirs and the company&#8217;s advantage. The @mention spawned the retweet, providing the analytics that drive Twitter&#8217;s indelible social graph. Instagram may be Facebook&#8217;s best attempt so far at challenging the fundamental strategic value that the former president used to dominate, but Clubhouse promises to go one big step better with its hybrid of mainstream media and a Warholesque factory engine that creates new stars and the media they generate. This in turn migrates through the entertainment disruption led by the streaming realignment. What exactly is this NFT thing really about?<\/p>\n<p>So Clubhouse has to open up its ability to multitask with Twitter and other curated social graphs. Facebook as a source for Clubhouse notifications and suggested conversations is different than Twitter\u2019s But patching into the sharing icon on iOS will offer substantial access to blunt Twitter&#8217;s native integration in Spaces. On the flip side, Twitter&#8217;s Revue newsletter tools present an opportunity to mine the burgeoning newsletter surge, using its drag and drop tools to bring not just default social network citations but the implicit social graph of curated editorial rockstars. Not only is the influencer audience rich in signal for advertisers, but these same brands will prove most attractive to Clubhouse listeners looking for value.

Let\u2019s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Despite some <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/05\/the-technology-selloff-is-getting-to-be-somewhat-material\/\">recent market volatility<\/a>, the valuations that software companies have generally been able to command in recent quarters have been impressive. On Friday, we <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/05\/understanding-how-investors-value-growth-in-2021\/\">took a look<\/a> into why that was the case, and where the valuations could be a bit more bubbly than others. Per <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/document\/497410287\/Battery-Ventures-Software-2021-Report\">a report<\/a> written by few Battery Ventures investors, it stands to reason that the middle of the SaaS market could be where valuation inflation is at its peak.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Something to keep in mind if your startup\u2019s growth rate is ticking lower. But today, instead of being an enormous bummer and making you worry, I have come with some historically notable data to show you how good modern software startups and their larger brethren have it today.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2121929 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-05-at-1.15.20-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"889\" height=\"204\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-05-at-1.15.20-PM.png 889w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-05-at-1.15.20-PM.png?resize=150,34 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-05-at-1.15.20-PM.png?resize=300,69 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-05-at-1.15.20-PM.png?resize=768,176 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-05-at-1.15.20-PM.png?resize=680,156 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Screen-Shot-2021-03-05-at-1.15.20-PM.png?resize=50,11 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 889px) 100vw, 889px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In case you are not 100% infatuated with tables, let me save you some time. In the upper right we can see that SaaS companies today that are growing at less than 10% yearly are trading for an average of 6.9x their next 12 months\u2019 revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Back in 2011, SaaS companies that were growing at 40% or more were trading at 6.0x their next 12 month\u2019s revenue. Climate change, but for software valuations.<\/p>\n<p>One more note from my chat with Battery. Its investor Brandon Gleklen riffed with The Exchange on the definition of ARR and its nuances in the modern market. As more SaaS companies swap traditional software-as-a-service pricing for its consumption-based equivalent, he declined to quibble on definitions of ARR, instead arguing that all that matters in software revenues is whether they are being retained and growing over the long term. This brings us to our next topic.<\/p>\n<h2>Consumption v. SaaS pricing<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019ve taken a number of earnings calls in the last few weeks with public software companies. One theme that\u2019s come up time and again has been consumption pricing versus more traditional SaaS pricing. There is some data showing that consumption-priced software companies are <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/18\/why-do-saas-companies-with-usage-based-pricing-grow-faster\/\">trading at higher multiples<\/a> than traditionally priced software companies, thanks to better-than-average retention numbers.<\/p>\n<p>But there is more to the story than just that. Chatting with Fastly CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/joshuabixby?lang=en\">Joshua Bixby<\/a> after his company&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/investors.fastly.com\/files\/doc_financials\/2020\/q4\/4Q20-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\">earnings report<\/a>, we picked up an interesting and important market distinction between where consumption may be more attractive and where it may not be. Per Bixby, Fastly is seeing larger customers prefer consumption-based pricing because they can afford variability and prefer to have their bills tied more closely to revenue. Smaller customers, however, Bixby said, prefer SaaS billing because it has rock-solid predictability.<\/p>\n<p>I brought the argument to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/poyark?lang=en\">Open View Partners Kyle Poyar<\/a>, a venture denizen who has been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/29\/subscription-based-pricing-is-dead-smart-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-models\/\">writing on this topic for TechCrunch<\/a> in recent weeks. He noted that in some cases the opposite can be true, that variably priced offerings can appeal to smaller companies because their developers can often test the product without making a large commitment.<\/p>\n<p>So, perhaps we\u2019re seeing the software market favoring SaaS pricing among smaller customers when they are certain of their need, and choosing consumption pricing when they want to experiment first. And larger companies, when their spend is tied to equivalent revenue changes, bias toward consumption pricing as well.<\/p>\n<p>Evolution in SaaS pricing will be slow, and never complete. But folks really are thinking about it. Appian CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/mattcalkins\/\">Matt Calkins<\/a> has a general pricing thesis that price should \u201chover\u201d under value delivered. Asked about the consumption-versus-SaaS topic, he was a bit coy, but did note that he was not \u201centirely happy\u201d with how pricing is executed today. He wants pricing that is a \u201cbetter proxy for customer value,\u201d though he declined to share much more.<\/p>\n<p>If you aren\u2019t thinking about this conversation and you run a startup, what&#8217;s up with that? More to come on this topic, including notes from an interview with the CEO of BigCommerce, who is betting on SaaS over the more consumption-driven Shopify.<\/p>\n<h2>Next Insurance, and its changing market<\/h2>\n<p>Next Insurance <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nextinsurance.com\/blog\/next-insurance-acquisition-ap-intego\/\">bought<\/a> another company this week. This time it was AP Intego, which will bring integration into various payroll providers for the digital-first SMB insurance provider. Next Insurance should be familiar because TechCrunch has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/10\/as-next-insurance-makes-its-first-acquisition-insurtech-looks-energetic\/\">written about its growth a few times<\/a>. The company doubled its premium run rate to $200 million in 2020, for example.<\/p>\n<p>The AP Intego deal brings $185.1 million of active premium to Next Insurance, which means that the neo-insurance provider has grown sharply thus far in 2021, even without counting its organic expansion. But while the Next Insurance deal and the <a href=\"https:\/\/hippo-static.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/investors\/Hippo+Reinvent+Presentation+March+2021+(vF+Announced).pdf\">impending Hippo SPAC<\/a> are neat notes from a hot private sector, insurtech has shed some of its public-market heat.<\/p>\n<p>Stocks of public neo-insurance companies like Root, Lemonade and MetroMile have <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/05\/the-technology-selloff-is-getting-to-be-somewhat-material\/\">lost quite a lot of value in recent weeks<\/a>. So, the exit landscape for companies like Next and Hippo &#8212; yet-private insurtech startups with lots of capital backing their rapid premium growth &#8212; is changing for the worse.<\/p>\n<p>Hippo decided it will debut via a SPAC. But I doubt that Next Insurance will pursue a rapid ramp to the public markets until things smooth out. Not that it needs to go public quickly; it raised a quarter billion back in September of last year.<\/p>\n<h2>Various and Sundry<\/h2>\n<p>What else?

Unlike a similar measure recently <a href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/technology-north-dakota-fargo-bills-legislation-e69d1f3b2efa1a3740070eddd7e2f1cf\">shot down by the North Dakota Senate,<\/a> this new bill doesn&#8217;t force app stores to offer alternative ways for developers to distribute their apps. Instead, it focuses on giving developers the right to use third-party systems that would allow them to circumvent the 15%-20% cut that Apple and Google take from app sales, in-app purchases and subscriptions.<\/p>\n<p>Apple and Google lobbyists <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocol.com\/policy\/apple-google-lobbyists-arizona-bill\">were already fighting against this bill<\/a> before it was even formally introduced by Arizona State Rep. Regina Cobb. Cobb says she was approached by a lobbyist representing Match Group and the Coalition for App Fairness (CAF) &#8212; the latter, which has organized some of Apple&#8217;s largest competitors &#8212; like Epic Games, Match Group, Spotify and Tile &#8212; to fight back against Apple&#8217;s control of the app ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>CAF had also backed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/02\/14\/technology\/north-dakota-tech-apps.html\">the North Dakota bill,<\/a>, and is helping push legislation in other states, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocol.com\/policy\/apple-google-lobbyists-arizona-bill\">Minnesota, Georgia and Hawaii.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Some legislators may oppose the bill on the grounds that these decisions are more of a federal matter and concerns over how the state would be able to enforce such a policy. The Arizona bill still has to make it through the Senate (and could be vetoed by Governor Doug Ducey) in order to become a law. If it did pass, it would make Arizona an attractive place to set up an app business and could set the groundwork for other states to pass similar legislation.<\/p>\n<h3>Animated family photos top the App Store<\/h3>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/MyHeritage?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MyHeritage<\/a> re-animated my grandma Anny (here 16 years old in 1936) and now I&#39;m crying tears of joy, hope, thankfulness, longing &amp; regrets \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude22\ud83d\udc94 <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/uXtjBz2UZV\">pic.twitter.com\/uXtjBz2UZV<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Susanne Wosnitzka \ud83c\udf79 (@Donauschwalbe) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Donauschwalbe\/status\/1365680787606151170?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 27, 2021<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>MyHeritage&#8217;s<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/26\/myheritage-now-lets-you-animate-old-family-photos-using-deepfakery\/\"> recently launched update<\/a> that lets users animate their old photos helped to send the app to the top of the App Store this week. The company had last week introduced &#8220;Deep Nostalgia&#8221; &#8212; a facial animation feature powered by technology from Israeli tech company (and TechCrunch Battlefield alum) D-ID. To animate the photos, the tech maps the facial features from the photo to a driver video to create what it calls a &#8220;live portrait.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The app went viral on social media, including TikTok, as people used the photo to animate long-ago relatives and other historical figures.<\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" style=\"max-width: 605px; min-width: 325px;\" cite=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@thomasflanigan_\/video\/6935162981919640837\" data-video-id=\"6935162981919640837\">\n<section><a title=\"@thomasflanigan_\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/@thomasflanigan_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@thomasflanigan_<\/a>The app is called MyHeritage <a title=\"greenscreenvideo\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/tag\/greenscreenvideo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">##greenscreenvideo<\/a> <a title=\"myheritage\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/tag\/myheritage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">##myheritage<\/a> <a title=\"mcdonaldsccsing\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/tag\/mcdonaldsccsing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">##McDonaldsCCSing<\/a> <a title=\"ancestors\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/tag\/ancestors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">##ancestors<\/a><a title=\"\u266c record before u listen - penny lane\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/music\/record-before-u-listen-6824616172181408517\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u266c record before u listen &#8211; penny lane<\/a><\/section>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/www.tiktok.com\/embed.js\"><\/script><\/p>\n<p>But in a number of more touching videos, people film themselves reacting to seeing their mom or dad &#8220;come to life&#8221; again through the tech, blinking, smiling and nodding, often set to &#8220;Remember When&#8221; by Alan Jackson or &#8220;Sign of the Times&#8221; by Harry Styles as the background track.<\/p>\n<p>Though MyHeritage shot up to become the No. 1 Overall app on the App Store as of Tuesday, a smaller startup, Rosebud, quietly pivoted to address the same use case with its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rosebud.ai\/tokkingheads\">TokkingHeads app<\/a>. The app, founded by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lishali.com\/\">Berkeley PhD Lisha Li<\/a>, was originally intended for making funny videos and memes with friends, video game avatars or celebs by animating portrait photos with text, speech and puppetry via video &#8212; but not so well that it would cross into &#8220;deepfake&#8221; territory.<\/p>\n<p>But after the release of MyHeritage&#8217;s update, TokkingHeads quickly updated to alert users to its own feature set, while also elevating the MyHeritage-like animations it offers in the app. As a result, the app started to gain a following of its own. On February 28, 2021, TokkingHeads saw 1,000 downloads. The next day, it had 8,000 downloads. The following two days, March 2 and 3, it saw 24,000 downloads and 28,000 downloads, respectively.<\/p>\n<p>The app has since reached as high as No. 12 in the App Store&#8217;s Entertainment category, as of the time of writing, and No. 94 Overall.

Lindy Fishburne on the seemingly sudden democratization of science"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Deep science investor Lindy Fishburne cofounded the seed- and early-stage venture firm <a href=\"https:\/\/breakout.vc\/\">Breakout Ventures<\/a> several years ago, after cofounding Breakout Labs within the Thiel Foundation back in 2011, and she has amassed a wide array of stakes in the process. Among her firm&#8217;s portfolio companies is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cortexyme.com\/\">Cortexyme<\/a>, a company that aims to treat Alzheimer&#8217;s disease; the sustainable materials maker <a href=\"https:\/\/www.modernmeadow.com\/\">Modern Meadow<\/a>; and <a href=\"https:\/\/strateos.com\/\">Strateos<\/a>, a company whose robotic cloud platform is remaking how lab work gets done.<\/p>\n<p>We talked with Fishburne late this week about where &#8212; based on what she is seeing &#8212; we are in the arc of this pandemic. We also talked about why more of her investments, which once seemed like long shots, suddenly look like solid bets. Parts of our chat, below, have been edited lightly for length and clarity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: We want to be excited about the progress being made in vaccinating Americans. Based on the conversations you&#8217;re having, what&#8217;s your sense of things?<\/strong><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>LF: The acceleration of the vaccines is like nothing we&#8217;ve ever seen before in science, and now we really are down to the unsexy part of of the logistics of rolling them out. That&#8217;s clearly our biggest challenge. Then the next piece we&#8217;re going to have to confront is what happens when the world is vaccinated [at] very unequal levels and how people feel about travel and exposure and equity along those issues.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Science has been the big story of the last year. Are you hearing from investors and potential syndicate partners who weren&#8217;t reaching out previously?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>LF: Yes. The pandemic has brought the importance of investing in science into sharp relief. For the first time, we&#8217;re really seeing a whole set of what you would think of as traditional tech investors who read about the mRNA vaccine that Moderna coded in a weekend and who are starting to believe that we&#8217;re able to engineer biology and that it doesn&#8217;t feel like a craft process anymore.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: You talk about coding a vaccine. Are laboratories becoming less important in that scientists are able to do much more in simulation and, if so, what does that mean for human testing? Are we getting to a point where we don&#8217;t have to rely on human testing as much as we did in the past?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>LF: That&#8217;s where we <em>hope<\/em> to get on the human testing piece. We&#8217;re not there yet. You may have read and heard about organs on a chip and growing organoids, where you can have a very small piece of liver that you&#8217;re able to test toxicity on [and] we&#8217;re doing more of that. That said, we&#8217;re not ready to make that leap from completely doing it in silico to humans with a super-high level of confidence.The human body is such a complex system that we&#8217;re not able to model that fully yet.<\/p>\n<p>I do think what you&#8217;re pointing toward to some degree is democratization in science and the access for more people to be able with lower skills to be able to work in drug discovery and drug development at a distance. So for example, we have a company that we&#8217;ve worked with called Strateos that has a full robotic lab that &#8212; instead of having technicians standing there &#8212; you have robots and a little train track that moves assays throughout the room so that scientists who were stuck at home this year were able to continue experiments regardless of their geography or safety in the lab or time constraints.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: You have another interesting portfolio company, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.opus-12.com\/\">Opus 12<\/a>, which is transforming industrial carbon dioxide emissions into chemicals. Toward what end?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>LF: So obviously, decarbonizing the world is a huge focus. And you&#8217;re seeing for the first time corporations like United Airlines making commitments as to what their carbon footprint will be, or going to zero carbon emissions. Opus 12 emerged from two PhDs and an MBA out of Stanford a few years ago and their breakthrough is a catalyst material that allows you to take for example, waste CO2 &#8212; the bad stuff &#8212; and run it through this catalyst material and produce useful CO. This year, for example, they produced green polycarbonate car parts in partnership with Daimler. The material is exactly the same, which makes it easy to slot into existing products, but it&#8217;s actually made by reusing carbon.<\/p>\n<p>The shift in consumer awareness around carbon made materials is an enormous opportunity.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Do companies get some sort of carbon credit for doing that?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>LF: Yes, and in the past what we&#8217;ve seen is a lot of companies trying to green themselves by basically buying and trading carbon credits, and the shift that we&#8217;re going through right now is everyone saying, &#8216;Okay, to some degree, that was a bit of financial engineering; now we actually need to see these businesses making a change in their direct use of fossil fuels and their direct impact in the amount of carbon.&#8217; [There&#8217;s growing awareness that] buying carbon offsets isn&#8217;t going to be enough. So you&#8217;re now for the first time really seeing commitments to change processes, supply chain and ultimately products.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: In recent years, biotech companies have been going public two and three years after being formed. Now, we&#8217;re seeing a much wider array of younger companies being transformed into public companies through a growing number of blank-check companies. Any thoughts about whether or not there are parallels here?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>LF: On the therapeutic side, you tend to have a very clear playbook around what the potential exit is and who the acquirers are. We know that big pharma is cash rich and pipeline poor, and so [these pharma giants] have to pick up the assets that are working, and you see them do that regularly. And you&#8217;ve got comps, and you know what that looks like,\u00a0 so in placing a wide range of bets on early-stage therapeutics, it&#8217;s clear that if one wins, you&#8217;re covered.<\/p>\n<p>The SPAC world is going to be really interesting because most of these companies are not operating off traditional playbooks, and it&#8217;s not clear whether they operate as public companies longer term. Are they really set up for acquisition?<\/p>\n<p>[Another] difference here is these companies are going to have this enormous amount of funding, and yet they&#8217;re not going to be able to toil in obscurity, so the traditional metrics that we all want [in] public companies and looking at revenue and profits and those metrics, we&#8217;re going to have to look at these SPACs and their growth through a different lens, and I&#8217;m just not sure how receptive the public markets will be to that in the next 24 months. I think it&#8217;s unclear whether we&#8217;ll have a reckoning there or not.<\/p>\n<p><em>If you&#8217;re curious to learn more, including about why new pots of money might be on the horizon for deep tech startups, you can listen in on our full conversation with Fishburne <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buzzsprout.com\/850276\/8087012\">here<\/a>.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Deep science investor Lindy Fishburne cofounded the seed- and early-stage venture firm Breakout Ventures several years ago, after cofounding Breakout Labs within the Thiel Foundation back in 2011, and she has amassed a wide array of stakes in the process.

Friday evening.<\/p>\n<p>Coursera was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/21\/edtech-startups-flirt-with-unicorn-style-growth\/\">last valued at $2.4 billion<\/a> by the private markets, when it most recently raised a Series F round in October 2020 that was worth $130 million.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1651562\/000119312521071525\/d65490ds1.htm\">Coursera\u2019s S-1 filing<\/a> offers a glimpse into the finances of how an edtech company, accelerated by the pandemic, performed over the past year. It paints a picture of growth, albeit one that came at steep expense.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Revenue<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>In 2020, Coursera saw $293.5 million in revenue. That\u2019s a roughly 59% increase from the year prior when the company recorded $184.4 million in top line. During that same period, Coursera posted a net loss of nearly $67 million, up 46% from the previous year\u2019s $46.7 million net deficit.<\/p>\n<p>Notably the company had roughly the same noncash, share-based compensation expenses in both years. Even if we allow the company to judge its profitability on an adjusted EBITDA basis, Coursera\u2019s losses still rose from 2019 to 2020, expanding from $26.9 million to $39.8 million.<\/p>\n<p>To understand the difference between net losses and adjusted losses it\u2019s worth unpacking the EBITDA acronym. Standing for &#8220;earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,&#8221; EBITDA strips out some nonoperating costs to give investors a possible better picture of the continuing health of a business, without getting caught up in accounting nuance. <em>Adjusted<\/em> EBITDA takes the concept one step further, also removing the noncash cost of share-based compensation, and in an even more cheeky move, in this case also deducts \u201cpayroll tax expense related to stock-based activities\u201d as well.<\/p>\n<p>For our purposes, even when we grade Coursera\u2019s profitability on a very polite curve it still winds up generating stiff losses. Indeed, the company\u2019s adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue &#8212; a way of determining profitability in contrast to revenue &#8212; barely improved from a 2019 result of -15% to -14% in 2020.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After TechCrunch broke the news yesterday that Coursera was planning to file its S-1 today, the edtech company officially dropped the document Friday evening.

Snowflake&#8217;s stock closed down around 4% today, a recovery compared to its midday lows when it was off nearly 12%.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Why the declines? Wall Street&#8217;s reaction to earnings can lean more on what a company will do next more than its most recent results. But Snowflake&#8217;s guidance for its current quarter appeared strong as well, with a predicted $195 million to $200 million in revenue, numbers in line with analysts&#8217; expectations.<\/p>\n<p>Sounds good, right? Apparently being in line with analyst expectations isn&#8217;t good enough for investors for certain companies. You see, it didn&#8217;t <em>exceed<\/em> the stated expectations, so the results must be bad. I am not sure how meeting expectations is as good as a miss, but there you are.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting of course that tech stocks have taken a beating so far in 2021. And as my colleague Alex Wilhelm <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/05\/the-technology-selloff-is-getting-to-be-somewhat-material\/\">reported this morning<\/a>, that trend only got worse this week. Consider that the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down 11.4% from its 52-week high, so perhaps investors are flogging everyone and Snowflake is merely caught up in the punishment.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Lr12QvKbHs\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/13\/9-investors-discuss-challenges-opportunities-and-the-impact-of-cloud-vendors-in-enterprise-data-lakes\/\">9 investors discuss hurdles, opportunities and the impact of cloud vendors in enterprise data lakes<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;9 investors discuss hurdles, opportunities and the impact of cloud vendors in enterprise data lakes&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/13\/9-investors-discuss-challenges-opportunities-and-the-impact-of-cloud-vendors-in-enterprise-data-lakes\/embed\/#?secret=Lr12QvKbHs\" data-secret=\"Lr12QvKbHs\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman pointed out in the earnings call this week that Snowflake is well positioned, something proven by the fact that his company has removed the data limitations of on-prem infrastructure. The beauty of the cloud is limitless resources, and that forces the company to help customers manage consumption instead of usage, an evolution that works in Snowflake&#8217;s favor.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The big change in paradigm is that historically in on-premise data centers, people have to manage capacity. And now they don\u2019t manage capacity anymore, but they need to manage consumption. And that\u2019s a new thing for &#8212; not for everybody but for most people &#8212; and people that are in the public cloud. I have gotten used to the notion of consumption obviously because it applies equally to the infrastructure clouds,&#8221; Slootman said in the earnings call.<\/p>\n<p>Snowflake has to manage expectations, something that translated into a dozen customers paying $5 million or more on a trailing 12 month basis, according to the company. That&#8217;s a nice chunk of change by any measure. It&#8217;s also clear that while there is a clear tilt toward the cloud, the amount of data that has been moved there is still a small percentage of overall enterprise workloads, meaning there is lots of growth opportunity for Snowflake.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s more, Snowflake executives pointed out that there is a significant ramp up time for customers as they shift data into the Snowflake data lake, but before they push the consumption button. That means that as long as customers continue to move data onto Snowflake&#8217;s platform, they will pay more over time, even if it will take time for new clients to get started.<\/p>\n<p>So why is Snowflake&#8217;s quarterly percentage growth not expanding? Well, as a company gets to the size of Snowflake, it gets harder to maintain those gaudy percentage growth numbers as the law of large numbers begins to kick in.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not here to tell Wall Street investors how to do their job, anymore than I would expect them to tell me how to do mine. But when you look at the company&#8217;s overall financial picture, the amount of untapped cloud potential and the nature of Snowflake&#8217;s approach to billing, it&#8217;s hard not to be positive about this company&#8217;s outlook, regardless of the reaction of investors in the short term.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note: This article originally stated the company had a dozen customer paying $5 million or more per month. It&#8217;s actually on a trailing 12 month basis and we have updated the article to reflect that.<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"p3WMatikaO\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/26\/salesforce-delivers-wall-street-doubts-as-stock-falls-6-3-post-earnings\/\">Salesforce delivers, Wall Street doubts as stock falls 6.3% post-earnings<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Salesforce delivers, Wall Street doubts as stock falls 6.3% post-earnings&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/26\/salesforce-delivers-wall-street-doubts-as-stock-falls-6-3-post-earnings\/embed\/#?secret=p3WMatikaO\" data-secret=\"p3WMatikaO\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Snowflake reported earnings this week, and the results look strong with revenue more than doubling year-over-year.

Cozmo, in particular, was well-received, and sold reasonably well &#8212; but ultimately (and in spite of a lot of funding), the company couldn\u2019t avoid the fate that\u2019s befallen many a robotics startup.<\/p>\n<p>It will be fascinating to see how these machines look when they\u2019re reintroduced. Anki invested tremendous resources into bringing them to life, including the hiring of ex-Pixar and DreamWorks staff to make the robots more lifelike. A lot of thought went into giving the robots a distinct personality, whereas, for instance, Vector\u2019s new owners are making the robot open-source. Cozmo, meanwhile, will have programmable functionality through the company\u2019s app.<\/p>\n<p>It could certainly be an interesting play for the STEM market that companies like Sphero are approaching. It has become a fairly crowded space, but at least Anki\u2019s new owners are building on top of a solid foundation, with the fascinating and emotionally complex toy robots their predecessors created.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Update:<\/strong> We removed a reference to a Kickstarter launched by Anki prior to Digital Dream&#8217;s acquisition of the company&#8217;s IP.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ecISq3dF1B\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/26\/where-these-4-top-vcs-are-investing-in-manufacturing\/\">Where these 4 top VCs are investing in manufacturing<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Where these 4 top VCs are investing in manufacturing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/26\/where-these-4-top-vcs-are-investing-in-manufacturing\/embed\/#?secret=ecISq3dF1B\" data-secret=\"ecISq3dF1B\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good robots don\u2019t die &#8212; they just have their assets sold off to the highest bidder.

possibly keep up with. But you can stay tolerably up to date on the most interesting developments with this column, which collects AI and machine learning advancements from around the world and explains why they might be important to tech, startups or civilization.<\/p>\n<p>To begin on a lighthearted note: The ways researchers find to apply machine learning to the arts are always interesting \u2014 though not always practical. A team from the University of Washington wanted to see if a computer vision system could learn to tell what is being played on a piano just from an overhead view of the keys and the player&#8217;s hands.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washington.edu\/news\/2021\/02\/04\/audeo-teaches-artificial-intelligence-play-piano\/\">Audeo<\/a>, the system trained by Eli Shlizerman, Kun Su and Xiulong Liu, watches video of piano playing and first extracts a piano-roll-like simple sequence of key presses. Then it adds expression in the form of length and strength of the presses, and lastly polishes it up for input into a MIDI synthesizer for output. The results are a little loose but definitely recognizable.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2115580\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audeo-diagram.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2115580\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2115580\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audeo-diagram.png\" alt=\"Diagram showing how video of a piano player's hands on the keys is turned into MIDI sequences.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"648\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audeo-diagram.png 2015w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audeo-diagram.png?resize=150,95 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audeo-diagram.png?resize=300,190 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audeo-diagram.png?resize=768,486 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audeo-diagram.png?resize=680,430 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audeo-diagram.png?resize=1536,972 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/audeo-diagram.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2115580\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Shlizerman, et. al<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;To create music that sounds like it could be played in a musical performance was previously believed to be impossible,&#8221; said Shlizerman. &#8220;An algorithm needs to figure out the cues, or &#8216;features,&#8217; in the video frames that are related to generating music, and it needs to &#8216;imagine&#8217; the sound that\u2019s happening in between the video frames. It requires a system that is both precise and imaginative. The fact that we achieved music that sounded pretty good was a surprise.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Another from the field of arts and letters is this extremely fascinating research into <a href=\"https:\/\/news.mit.edu\/2021\/researchers-virtually-open-sealed-historic-letters-0302\">computational unfolding<\/a> of ancient letters too delicate to handle. The MIT team was looking at &#8220;locked&#8221; letters from the 17th century that are so intricately folded and sealed that to remove the letter and flatten it might permanently damage them. Their approach was to X-ray the letters and set a new, advanced algorithm to work deciphering the resulting imagery.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2121182\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/unfolding-mit.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2121182\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2121182\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/unfolding-mit.jpg\" alt=\"Diagram showing x-ray views of a letter and how it is analyzed to virtually unfold it.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"875\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/unfolding-mit.jpg 1351w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/unfolding-mit.jpg?resize=150,128 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/unfolding-mit.jpg?resize=300,256 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/unfolding-mit.jpg?resize=768,657 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/unfolding-mit.jpg?resize=680,581 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/unfolding-mit.jpg?resize=50,43 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2121182\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Diagram showing X-ray views of a letter and how it is analyzed to virtually unfold it. <strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> MIT<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The algorithm ends up doing an impressive job at separating the layers of paper, despite their extreme thinness and tiny gaps between them, sometimes less than the resolution of the scan,&#8221; MIT&#8217;s Erik Demaine said. &#8220;We weren&#8217;t sure it would be possible.&#8221; The work may be applicable to many kinds of documents that are difficult for simple X-ray techniques to unravel.

a new social platform called the Tesla Engagement Platform, a move that&#8217;s raised the ire of a community of its most ardent supporters.<\/p>\n<p>Tesla first announced the new engagement platform with a notice at the top of its forums page that reads: &#8220;Starting March 15th, Tesla Forums will become read only. To continue the conversation with the Tesla community visit engage.tesla.com.&#8221; The Verge was the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/3\/5\/22315339\/tesla-social-platform-cleaner-energy-forums-charity\"> first to report the changes<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than create posts and threads, the new site invites owners and fans of the brand to engage by commenting on Tesla&#8217;s public-policy-related posts and campaigns that run the gamut, including calls to support the company&#8217;s disaster relief efforts in Texas and requests for Nebraskans to ask their state lawmakers to encourage the passing of a bill that would allow the direct sale of Teslas in certain districts.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In the replies of a <a href=\"https:\/\/forums.tesla.com\/discussion\/183426\/end-of-tesla-forums\">March 2 Tesla forum post<\/a> announcing the 13-day countdown until the platform&#8217;s demise, one commenter with supposed &#8220;inside info&#8221; alleged that the forums were closing because Tesla couldn&#8217;t afford to hire multiple full-time moderators to keep up with the barrage of spam and trolls that would frequent the threads.<\/p>\n<p>Those trolls are likely to migrate to Twitter now, as the Tesla Engagement Platform will be moderated.<\/p>\n<p>The forums, which will now be available as read-only archives, were a place for Tesla fans, investors and verified owners to ask and answer each other&#8217;s questions. However, the unmoderated nature of the forum led to an environment where its most active posters would, at times, attack people for raising concerns. The new microsite, which also helps people apply for membership to local owners&#8217; clubs, promises a direct feedback loop with the company&#8217;s policy team and encourages visitors to get involved in Tesla advocacy.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Engage Tesla is a new platform for both Tesla&#8217;s public policy team and Tesla Owner&#8217;s Clubs,&#8221; reads the <a href=\"https:\/\/engage.tesla.com\/articles\/14-welcome-tesla-engagement-platform\">first post on the new microsite<\/a>. &#8220;Its goal is to create a digital home base for all of our work, and make it easier for Tesla community members to learn what&#8217;s top of mind for us, take meaningful action, and stay in the loop. We hope you&#8217;ll join us in getting involved.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A quick skim through the comments section of the first post reveals a bevy of unhappy users who want the forums to stay, or at least remade into something similar &#8212; and moderated &#8212; on the new site. There are no shortage of Tesla and other EV-related forums on the internet. This one has been held up as a bastion of toxicity, while being lauded as a place for owners and potential buyers to share honest information on the good and bad parts of the company&#8217;s products.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Please do not get rid of the Forums,&#8221; implored one commenter. &#8220;This is not a replacement. The forums (with exception of the trolls on it) brought about informed discussion to help fellow owners with issues.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, the new platform doesn&#8217;t appear to be a replacement. It looks more like a blog that shares industry news, Tesla events and campaigns, an effort to gather the work already being done by its supporters in one place and encourage further advocacy on the company&#8217;s behalf. For example, the Tesla Owners club in Silicon Valley had already raised $10,000 to support the Del Valle, Texas community, which surrounds the area in which the company&#8217;s new factory is being built.<\/p>\n<p>Not everyone is a critic. While many of the initial comments on the platform&#8217;s first post call for a moderated forum, some suggest improvements to the company&#8217;s customer service department and others request resources on how to advocate for public charging infrastructure. It&#8217;s still early days for the new engagement platform. We&#8217;ll see how engaging Tesla&#8217;s fans truly find it to be.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"8bdEWLhSXh\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/24\/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs\/\">Can solid state batteries power up for the next generation of EVs?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Can solid state batteries power up for the next generation of EVs?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/24\/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs\/embed\/#?secret=8bdEWLhSXh\" data-secret=\"8bdEWLhSXh\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tesla plans to shut down the forums section on its website as it launches a new social platform called the Tesla Engagement Platform, a move that&#8217;s raised the ire of a community of its most ardent supporters.

bill would require all self-driving vehicles to be zero emission by 2025"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">California might be the first state to give self-driving cars a deadline to electrify.<\/p>\n<p>In mid-February, a bill was quietly introduced into the California State Legislature that would require all autonomous vehicles to also be zero emission by 2025. Proposed <a href=\"https:\/\/leginfo.legislature.ca.gov\/faces\/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB500\">Bill SB 500<\/a>, which was introduced by Senator Dave Min and sponsored by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), would directly affect the nascent AV industry in applications like ride-hailing, delivery and trucking.<\/p>\n<p>The amendment is in line with many of California&#8217;s goals to reduce emissions. It would add to the state&#8217;s vehicle code, which currently provides for programs to promote zero-emission vehicles, such as the Clean Vehicle Rebate Project and the Charge Ahead California Initiative.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Governor Gavin Newsom has said he wants all new vehicle sales to be zero emission by 2035, but that doesn&#8217;t apply to commercial fleets. Not unless this bill is passed. The proposed bill is in its infancy stages, so there are plenty of opportunities for it to be quashed. But it surfaces an issue for a burgeoning AV industry and the companies trying to develop and commercialize autonomous driving technology in California. It also has the potential to provide a boost to the companies that only use electric vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;California has set important standards to aggressively address our climate crisis,&#8221; Min told TechCrunch. &#8220;My SB 500 aligns with these ambitions and takes a critical first step in requiring autonomous vehicles to be zero emission before they are put to widespread use.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Proponents of the bill don&#8217;t want to see future means of transportation married to the technology of the past, pointing out the potential for AVs to either help or hurt attempts to cut emissions. California has a reputation for leading the rest of the country in EV adoption and other emissions-related policies, so the success or failure of this bill could create ripple effects in states across the nation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It definitely seems like we&#8217;re going to start seeing AVs in these fleet applications, whether that&#8217;s ride-hailing or delivery, and that makes it even more important that these vehicles are electric,&#8221; said Elizabeth Irvin, senior transportation analyst at UCS. &#8220;The average person drives their car 11,000 to 13,000 miles per year, but a full-time Uber or Lyft driver drives 30,000 or more.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>The strategy<\/h2>\n<p>Close to half of California&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation. And while there&#8217;s nothing quite like a smoggy Los Angeles sunset, supporters say the danger of not placing requirements on the AV industry could lead to a world in which autonomous commercial vehicles are commonplace and powered by fossil fuels.<\/p>\n<p>In a statement defending support of this bill, UCS points to research that shows how AVs could dramatically increase driving, and thus emissions, as people get used to living the luxurious life of a passenger.<a href=\"https:\/\/ucsusa.org\/sites\/default\/files\/attach\/2019\/02\/Where-Are-Self-Driving-Cars-Taking-Us-web.pdf\"> One study<\/a>, which examined the potential effects of AVs on the Washington, D.C. metropolitan region transportation system in 2040, found that AVs would cause the total amount of driving to increase by as much as 66% relative to the 2040 baseline year.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ytX9CqIjWZ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/27\/californias-self-driving-car-reports-are-public-heres-what-they-dont-mean\/\">California&#8217;s self-driving car reports are public.

The Ford Fusion hybrid and Chrysler Pacifica Plug-in Hybrid minivans have been the go-to choices for AV developers, including Argo AI, Aurora, Waymo and Voyage.<\/p>\n<p>Argo AI is a technology platform company that works with major automakers, like Volkswagen and Ford, to develop autonomous driving systems. While Volkswagen&#8217;s ID.Buzz will be the company&#8217;s first fully electric self-driving car, Ford still prefers to take a more measured approach by modifying the hybrid Ford Fusion.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We all want to transition to BEVs eventually, but we also need to find the right balance that will help develop a profitable, viable business model,&#8221; John Davis, chief engineer at Ford Autonomous Vehicles said. &#8220;This means launching with hybrids first.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Davis outlined various challenges in developing all-electric vehicles as AVs, including depletion of range from on-board tech, decreased use of the vehicle during charge times and degradation of the battery.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Testing shows that upwards of 50% of BEV range will be used up due to the computing power of an AV system, plus the A\/C and entertainment systems that are likely required during a ride-hailing service (for passenger comfort),&#8221; Davis said. &#8220;We continue to be encouraged as battery chemistry and cost continue to improve to address these issues.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1907217\" style=\"width: 3630px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/GettyImages-1142125645.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1907217\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-1907217 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/GettyImages-1142125645.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3620\" height=\"2343\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/GettyImages-1142125645.jpg 3620w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/GettyImages-1142125645.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/GettyImages-1142125645.jpg?resize=300,194 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/GettyImages-1142125645.jpg?resize=768,497 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/GettyImages-1142125645.jpg?resize=680,440 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/GettyImages-1142125645.jpg?resize=1536,994 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/GettyImages-1142125645.jpg?resize=2048,1326 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/GettyImages-1142125645.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3620px) 100vw, 3620px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-1907217\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image credits<\/strong>: Andrej Sokolow\/dpa picture alliance via Getty Images<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Waymo tested and then launched a robotaxi service in a limited and growing area in the Phoenix suburbs. And while the company has never officially announced it will launch a commercial service in California, its activities over the years all point to that intention. The Mountain View, California-based company regularly tests its vehicles, which includes the electric Jaguar I-Pace, in San Francisco and the surrounding area. The company said it supports Newsom&#8217;s recent executive order, but stopped short of endorsing the current language in Min&#8217;s bill.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As the first company to commercially deploy our fully autonomous technology to the public, we strongly support the goals outlined in Governor Newsom&#8217;s recent Executive Order N-79-20 which takes a holistic approach to transition California towards a 100% EV future,&#8221; a Waymo spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Waymo has business lines and partnerships that span ride-hailing, trucking and local delivery, and we want to ensure that California&#8217;s EV policy reflects the myriad issues and industries affected. It&#8217;s early in the legislative process, and we look forward to working with Sen. Min in his efforts.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Industry sources familiar with the bill have noted that the current language, which is fairly brief, is just a placeholder and unlikely to make much headway this session. Those same sources have criticized the sponsors and author for neglecting to specify a plan for charging infrastructure or making distinctions between light and heavy-duty vehicles. Trucks carrying freight are expected to be among the first vehicles with widespread autonomous use. Most self-driving truck development occurs outside of California in regulatory-light states like Arizona and Texas. And while there are some efforts to develop electric and autonomous semi trucks, most testing today involves diesel-powered vehicles. That could prompt companies hoping to deploy in California to lean on the senator&#8217;s office to include an exemption for heavy-duty vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re still looking to fill out details as we move through the legislative process, but UCS&#8217;s intention is that this bill stay focused on the electrification requirement,&#8221; responded Irvin.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><em><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/26\/techcrunch-early-stage-is-the-startup-bootcamp-youve-always-needed\/?tpcc=ECTW2020\">Early Stage<\/a> is the premier \u2018how-to\u2019 event for startup entrepreneurs and investors.

often a formality.

The choose-your-own-adventure type of work style is part of the magic of startups and often why generalists thrive here.<\/p>\n<p>However, as a company progresses and the team grows, there comes a time when a founder needs to carve out dedicated roles. Of these positions, product management might be one of the most elusive \u2014 and key \u2014 roles to fill.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--right\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tProduct management might be one of the most elusive \u2014 and key \u2014 roles to fill.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>We spoke to startup founders and operators to get their thoughts about how and when they hired their first product manager. Some of the things we talked about were:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a0Which traits to look for.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Why it&#8217;s important to define the role before you look for your best fit.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0Whether your new hire needs to have a technical background.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0The best questions to ask in an interview.<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0How to time your first hire and avoid overhiring.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Don\u2019t hire for the CEO of a product<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s start by working backward. Product managers often graduate into a CEO role or leave a company to become a founder. Like founders, talented product managers have innate leadership skills and are able to effectively and clearly communicate. Similarly, both roles require a person who is a visionary when it comes to the product and execution.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/davidblake?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">David Blake<\/a> was a product manager before he became a serial edtech founder who created <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/16\/degreed-lands-new-cash-for-upskilling-in-a-down-market\/\">Degreed<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/16\/learn-in-thinks-a-solution-to-layoffs-is-more-sabbaticals\/\">Learn In<\/a>, and most recently,<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/09\/24\/the-first-rule-of-bookclub-no-boring-book-clubs\/\"> BookClub<\/a>. He says that experience helped him launch the first prototype of Degreed and attract first clients.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe must-have skill is the ability to put the team&#8217;s best wisdom in check and inform the product decisions with users and potential clients to inform what you are building,\u201d he said. The person \u201cmust also be able to take the team&#8217;s mission and develop and sell that narrative to users and potential clients. That is how you blaze a new trail, balance risk, while avoiding building a &#8216;faster horse.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The overlapping synergies between PMs and founders is part of the reason why the role is so confusing to define and hire for. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kennorton.com\/about\/\">Ken Norton,<\/a> former director of product at Figma who recently left to solo advise and coach product managers, says companies can start by defining what PMs are not: The CEO of the product.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s about not handing off the product responsibilities to somebody,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want the founder and the CEO to continue to be the evangelist and visionary.\u201d Instead, the role is more about day to day \u201cblocking and tackling.&#8221; Norton wrote a piece more than 15 years ago about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kennorton.com\/essays\/productmanager.html\">how to hire a product manager<\/a>, and it&#8217;s still an essential read for anyone interested in the field.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Define the role and set your expectations <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Product managers help translate all the jugglers within a startup to each other; connecting the engineer with marketing, design with business development and sales with all the above. The role at its core is hard to define, but at the same time is the necessary plumbing for any startup that wants to be high-growth and ambitious.<\/p>\n<p>While a successful product manager is a strong generalist, they have to have the ability to understand and humanize technical processes. The best candidates, then, have some sort of technical experience as an engineer or otherwise.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the world of early-stage startups, job titles are often a formality.
