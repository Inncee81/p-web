          We don’t see divisions between angel, seed and pre-seed — we’re interested across the board and find that founders’ needs are the same early on. In fact, most of our 300+ companies came to us when they were a couple people and an idea, having raised no capital before they met us. So, even if you don’t think you’re ready, we’d still like to get to know you. Maybe we can even help in the meantime.

          Of course not. While we’re usually the first money in, we’ve worked with a number of teams that raised a small friends and family round before coming to us. That said, if you’ve already raised more than a few million dollars, we’re probably not a fit.

          Yes, our investments tend to cluster around enterprise, consumer, hardware, fintech and healthcare. That’s not where our curiosity ends. If you’re building something different, we still want to hear from you and learn about the vision of the future you have in mind.

What in your history shows that you thrive off the beaten path? Of course, we evaluate product and market too, but to be honest, we mostly look at that to evaluate the strength of founders too. Looking at what you’ve done already for this company — and before in your career — gives us a record of hundreds if not thousands of decisions you’ve made to get you where you are today. And that’s what success lives or dies on in this industry: the ability for founders to make really quick, good decisions. We want to understand how you do it, and we give that a lot of weight.

SaaS companies have a different range of opportunities than on-premise  software makers. First-party retailers are valued very differently from third-party ecommerce sites. To mix our metaphors, before a founder starts building their castle, they have to make sure they’ve picked the right piece of land.

          Building an enduring company is ridiculously hard. You have to overcome inertia, have an unbelievable amount of conviction, and be willing to drive through brick walls. You can’t wait for someone to hand you a roadmap. You can’t even wait for a roadmap to come into focus. You have to be able to draw it yourself and execute at the same time. This is an exceedingly rare set of skills — and it’s what we seek to find in every founder conversation we have.

           Delayed gratification.
          </b>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
           Being a founder is a constant, grueling exercise in deferring happiness and victory. The most successful entrepreneurs are willing to sacrifice in the short term for long term impact. When we consider working with you as a founder, we look for your willingness to make these tradeoffs earlier in your life and career. Did you skip spring break to pursue a long-term project? Did you work while you were in school? Have you built anything that took months in heads-down crunch mode to make possible?
          </span>
         </li>
         <li>
          <b>
           Admit unknowns.
          </b>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
           We’re always meeting the same two types of entrepreneurs. The first thinks they’re expected to know the answer to every question. So they’ll make sure they have a definitive response always, even if they shouldn’t. They’ll tell us their pricing model. Why they’ll be competitive with Google. What will cause customer churn in three years. Whenever we try to address potential risks, they tell us they don’t exist. This is not our ideal type of founder.
          </span>
          The second type of entrepreneur will answer questions when they can, but when they don’t know, they say so. When asked the same question about pricing, they might say, “Well, we’re considering a few different options depending on the outcome of some tests we’re running.” When asked about the cost of customer acquisition, their response could be, “We don’t know what our numbers will be, but here’s our model based on comparable companies.” When asked about the risks, they identify several — and engage us in discussion about how to handle them.
          <b>
           The founder who volunteers their ignorance has far more credibility
          </b>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
           . No one expects a pre-launch company to have all the answers. In fact, it’s a red flag if you think you do. Don’t sell us on being 100% correct. We’d much rather understand how you’re attacking the market, evaluating the risks, and taking on unknowns.

           Good storytelling.
          </b>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
           All successful founders can deliver a compelling narrative. They have to be able to sell against the status quo. They have to convince investors and employees that this incredibly unlikely thing they’re doing is about to take the world by storm. They have to capture media attention, keep their board aligned and energized, and consistently bring new customers into the fold. If a founder can’t tell an amazing story, it’ll be hard for them to do any of this.  If you’re interested in developing these skills, be sure to read

           Great founders move very, very fast. So if we meet with an entrepreneur over six weeks, we’re watching closely what they’re accomplishing at the same time. If the company’s been around for 90 days or 6 months, we want to see how much they’ve gotten done in that period. There are a ton of leading indicators there.

          These answers vary from company to company, but there are some basic steps everyone goes through. While we often try to move at the pace of the founder, an important rule applies: the less time we have to make a decision, the more conviction we have to feel about a company. Sometimes we spend months developing a relationship (which, honestly, we prefer). Sometimes we move from intro to close in under a week. Generally speaking, here’s what you can expect:

        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          <b>
           Initial meeting:
          </b>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
           In advance of an initial meeting, we’ll look at any materials sent by the founder, determine whether the business fits our basic investment criteria, and try to ensure it’s not directly competitive with any of our existing investments. Your first meeting (or phone call) with a member of the investment team will typically be between 45 minutes and an hour.
          </span>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
           We let the founder do most of the talking, and hope they use the opportunity to dig into the specifics of their team and business.
          </span>
         </li>

          <b>
           Second meeting
          </b>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
           : Most of our “passes” occur after the initial meeting.
          </span>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
           If you’ve made it past that meeting, you’ll spend more time with your First Round point partner as we both continue to learn more about each other.
          </span>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
           This is our chance to focus in on particular areas of the business where we have questions — and for founders to ask us more about First Round, what working with us is like, and what they could expect as a member of our community.
          </span>
         </li>

           Follow-up:
          </b>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
           Our partnership makes all decisions as a team. So, we often introduce promising founders to another First Round partner for an additional conversation. We often like to introduce the founder to the partner who has the “most skepticism” about the company at this point – as it ensures that all questions are addressed and gives us the ability to probe more deeply into the core assumptions of the business for an hour.

          <span style="font-weight: 400;">
           : If these conversations go well for both of us, we’ll typically make some reference/diligence calls and invite you to meet with the rest of the partners at our twice-weekly investment meeting. Here, you’ll have about an hour to tell your story to the entire partnership and answer questions. Typically, we fund about half of the companies that make it to our partner meeting.

           After your presentation, our partnership will discuss your company in great detail with the goal to give you a final answer usually within 24 hours of the meeting.

          Ideas are easy to describe on paper. People are not. That’s why we value referrals from people we know and trust. This includes people leading and employed by First Round companies, angel investors, other entrepreneurs, service providers like lawyers, accountants, bankers, recruiters, etc. It gives us more data to work with.

         A direct referral will get a quicker response, but don’t be afraid to email us yourself. We know good ideas can come from anywhere, so our partners review every single investment opportunity we receive, whether it’s through a warm intro or cold outreach.

          We tend to focus exclusively on companies based in the U.S. because that is where we have the most experience and can be the most valuable partners. We’ve made a few exceptions for companies headquartered in Canada (like Buddybuild in Vancouver) and companies whose management is located in the US but has overseas development teams, but in general if you’re located outside of North America, we’re probably not the right investors for you.

          While our partners have different and diverse interest areas, we’re extremely collegial in how we work. We often evaluate investment opportunities as a group and frequently hand off companies to the partner who has the most experience in the space (or is located in the right geography).  The investment team constantly talks about everything they’re seeing and what they find interesting. So don’t hesitate to get in touch with your closest connection to get the ball rolling.

          Typically, our initial investment in a startup ranges from $750k to $4 million, but we’ve gone higher and lower in some cases. Currently, our average initial investment is right around $2 million. As the largest seed-stage venture fund in the country, we’re very serious about supporting our companies with follow-on investing. In fact, we reserve equal amounts of capital for our follow-on investment as our initial investment.

          No. Unlike some traditional venture funds who need 20 to 25% ownership requirements, we don’t. We like to own enough of the company to make sure that we can dedicate meaningful time and resources to helping you build. Our ideal ownership is roughly 15% after your seed round.

          While we tend to lead most of the time, we’re not the lead investor about ⅓ of the time. We have a long track record of partnering with outstanding seed-stage VCs and angels.

          We’re focused on being the world’s best partner for founders at the very first stages of company creation — so we’ve designed the firm to do just that. When you work with First Round, you get super active partners working side-by-side with you on your biggest and smallest challenges.  Whether it’s setting strategy for a fundraise or thinking through your organizational design, we’re in your corner through the thick and thin of company building over those first few critical years.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         On top of that, you get access to our 15-person Platform Team, working to help you fast forward through the tough nitty-gritty of building a company so you can focus on what makes yours special. Whether it’s our Pitch Assist Team building your Series A deck, or our Talent Team connecting you with top-tier candidates, we’re here to help across all your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-weight: 400;">
          Most importantly, we pioneered the concept of transforming a portfolio into a community. When our partners were entrepreneurs themselves, the most valuable advice and support they ever received came from other founders. That’s why we provide the tools and forums you need for employees throughout your company to learn from and help their peers. If you’re a PM, a CFO or a junior marketer, you can benefit from the collective wisdom of many others. For more on how we do this and the services we offer, check out our

          in follow-on capital after our initial investment across 1,000 rounds — and we’ve watched them all closely. This makes raising capital one area where our partners will always have more experience than our founders, no matter how brilliant they are. Leveraging this knowledge, we do everything we can to help our companies get to Series A and beyond.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         These learnings are an integral part of our Pitch Assist program, developed to help companies get through what’s undoubtedly the toughest part of starting something new. Every engagement starts with strategy meeting with our partnership. We figure out which VCs founding teams should pitch and in what order based on our experience with almost every tier one investor in the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once a coherent strategy is set, we pair entrepreneurs with a dedicated designer and content expert for a 4-6 week boot camp. They come out the other side with a finalized fundraising plan, a compelling narrative, a gorgeous presentation (built in-house here at First Round) and a bulletproof story that showcases their unique value prop. First Round founders also get tons of rehearsal time with our entire partnership to make sure they nail their presentations right out of the gate.
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-weight: 400;">
          Since launching in 2014, Pitch Assist has helped over 30 companies raise more than $500M. As market conditions shift and the Series A pool shrinks, we’re seeing this kind of resource become a serious advantage.

          As an early-stage founder, the future is always hard to predict. You’re assessing the potential for big product bets, impact of new hires, shifts in go-to-market strategy and hundreds of other items large and small. Today, the COVID-19 health crisis and uncertain economic outlook makes these types of predictions even more difficult.
         </span>
         <b>
          But we believe that founders shouldn’t have to try to predict how (and whether) their existing investors will support them in the next round.
         </b>
         <span style="font-weight: 400;">
          We think that consistency and transparency is paramount — particularly when things get tough.

        <p>
         <span style="font-weight: 400;">
          As one of the largest “pure play” seed-stage funds, First Round has been able to support our companies financially by participating in their second round. In fact, when we’ve led a first round in the last five years, we’ve offered to take our pro rata (or more) in the second round over 96% of the time.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-weight: 400;">
          Given the uncertainty in today’s market, we’ve decided to explicitly state how we will participate in the second round going forward.
         </span>
         <span style="font-weight: 400;">
          That’s why we’re now creating the “
          <b>
           Second Round Guarantee
          </b>
          .” Our aim is to bring a bit of clarity to this often murky question founders face.
         </span>
        </p>
        <p>
         <span style="font-weight: 400;">
          Here’s how it works: When we lead your first round (whether it’s a pre-seed, mango seed, small Series A or anything in between), we’ll be there for you in your second. More specifically, we
         </span>
         <span style="font-weight: 400;">
          guarantee
         </span>
         <span style="font-weight: 400;">
          that we will always take our pro rata in your next outside-led venture round, with a commitment of up to $3M. If the Series A round is over $20M, we may not take our full pro rata, but will invest at least $3M.

          Our mission is to build and serve the strongest community of entrepreneurs. Diversity, equity and inclusion are core to the strongest communities around the world and thus, are core to the First Round Community. We hope that this FAQ clearly communicates our views, our commitment, and the specific actions we’re taking to make this goal a reality.

         <span style="font-weight: 400;">
          We know that there’s more work to be done to increase the presence of women and people from underrepresented backgrounds in First Round’s cohort of founders, in our own team, in the teams recruited by our portfolio companies, as well as within the broader startup community. We also deeply understand that diversity, equity and inclusion is not just a gender issue. For too long, the tech and startup community (including us) has failed across a broader spectrum, particularly when it comes to people of color, the LGBTQ+ community, persons with disabilities and other underrepresented folks.

          We’re committed to taking steps across all aspects of our day-to-day work to reduce implicit and overt bias, and increase inclusion. This goes far beyond the stats and numbers (though we appreciate that opening up about those really matters too). Because we believe in taking an iterative approach to the way we operate at First Round, we’re opening up about what we’ve done thus far:

           for example, we’re proud that we’ve built one of the most diverse angel investing groups out there. Across 145 members and 6 cohorts, 47% of participants were women and 21% came from underrepresented backgrounds. We’ve also expanded the program to include other geographies outside of our office locations in San Francisco and New York — and we’re excited to get to know and support more emerging angel investors outside of existing centers of power in tech. By being conscious and intentional about how we expand our community in these ways, we hope to make First Round more approachable for founders from all backgrounds. We’ve also taken concerted efforts to create space in our community for individuals in underrepresented groups to come together and connect. A few years ago, we launched a private, internal community for women across First Round companies called +Women. It’s built on top of our core community platform and is now a place for over 1,400 women to connect and learn from each other. In the past few years, we also launched an LGBTQ+ group and a Black &amp; Latinx group on Network. We regularly run coffee chats, monthly meet-ups, affinity groups, and mentorship relationships specifically dedicated to these communities.

Now, Fast Track cohort spots are open to Black or Latinx founders and employees working at a startup (under 1,000 people) in any function. As a result, in our latest mentorship round, 36% of the +500 Mentees in our cohort came from underrepresented backgrounds. Since Fast Track was founded in 2016, we’ve witnessed the incredibly powerful effects that mentorship can have on career trajectories. But we also recognize that underrepresented founders are often over-mentored and underfunded — expanding access to this impactful program is a small step in concert with other initiatives.

           Every time a role opens on our team, we work hard to source a diverse pipeline of candidates, engage as broad a field as possible, and try to check bias at the door of every interview. We spend the majority of our outbound efforts sourcing outside of our existing networks to find incredible underrepresented candidates. More tactically, we’ve instituted the Rooney Rule, meaning we ensure at least one underrepresented candidate makes it to the final interview round before we extend an offer. We also run structured interviews with a pre-set list of competencies and questions and have introduced techniques like blind grading exercises to continue removing bias. Right now, our full-time team identifies as 56% female and 27% Black, Indigenous, People Of Color. We’re proud of the team these efforts have produced, but we know we can do better. We’ll continue to invest heavily in building a First Round team to match the world around us.

           The evolution of our partnership is an effort that has and will continue to play out in the coming years and decades, as it has ever since Howard and Josh started First Round back in 2004. One consistent theme, however, is that openings are relatively rare and our partnership is intentionally small. (As of 2020, we had added just 2 new investing partners in the previous 8 years.) This past summer, our focus was to take a closer look at the process by which we add new partners. In the case of Todd, Hayley and Bill (our previous three hires) we didn’t run a formal recruiting search — all were former First Round founders whom the partnership had gotten to know over many years.

We were quickly overwhelmed by the response we got back, and ended up reviewing over 1,000 candidates — one of whom was our newest partner, Meka Asonye. While we don’t have specific requirements on gender or background when we’re hiring for a specific role, we do have a long-term goal (and a strongly-held desire) to make the First Round partnership more diverse and more representative than it is today. Moving forward, we’ll continue to look at adding to our partnership, and continue to make improvements so we can run a better, more fair hiring process that will enable us to meet with all kinds of candidates.

          Many early-stage founders don’t come in with an innate sense of how they’ll acquire customers. They might know the usual levers to pull and experiments to run, but every company is different — and sometimes very different if they’re working in a new industry or domain. Whether you’re a consumer company trying to nail early paid marketing or an enterprise company crafting its go-to-market strategy, the best way to get up to speed fast is the same:

         In addition to being entrepreneurs themselves, our partners have worked with hundreds of founders on their early growth and customer acquisition plans and experiments. We’ve seen every type of company, sector and tactic — and we make a point of sharing all we know (and lessons hard won by our other companies) in working sessions between partners and founders, often every other week.

          It’s our job to make it easy to find. First Round Network allows our entire community (everyone at all of our companies) to candidly air their worries and problems, ask questions, present their problems, and help others with what they’ve learned. Most questions asked on Network are answered within 24 hours, giving people a nearly real-time resource whenever they hit a wall. Many of the questions focus on customer acquisition and growth, how to evaluate the costs involved, what has already worked for others, and pathways through scaling.

Hailing from incredible careers at companies inside and outside the First Round portfolio, these folks have told us what they know in granular detail so we can match them very specifically to the right problem-solving opportunities — all on demand. So whether a startup needs to know how to restructure its sales team, which A/B test to run on its landing page, or how to calculate its CAC and LTV, we can set them up for a call, coffee or meeting that will neutralize the problem and slingshot them forward, fast.

          Outside of board meetings, we prefer what we call “working sessions.” Every 4 to 6 weeks, we go deep with a founder on a big challenge. We’ll spend the entire meeting working through the problem, and we’ve found this type of collaboration far more valuable than traditional reporting and governance. That said, we know how to operate and make an impact in more formal meetings too. (And, by the by, if you’re looking for board meeting best practices, check out this

        <p>
         We pick our investors very carefully. It’s important to us that we generate returns for shareholders we can be proud of and who share our values. The vast majority of the capital we invest comes from non-profit organizations such as:
        </p>
        <p>
         – Universities that educate students of all backgrounds
         <br/>
         – Hospitals working on groundbreaking treatments
         <br/>
         – A wide variety of charities tackling today’s biggest problems
        </p>
        <p>
         In light of the recent troubling news coming out of Saudi Arabia, we want to specifically highlight that we do not have sovereign wealth funds or governments of any kind as investors in First Round.
