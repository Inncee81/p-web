Expanding its geographic footprint beyond its home ground is a significant step for the company. With this move, Raksul became the very first Japanese technology startup to set up its R&D center outside of Japan.\n\nA publicly traded company that is listed in the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Raksul started its journey in 2009 launched its first offering as a listing and facilitating web service which allowed users to look up and compare the prices of various printing services. Although the service very quickly attracted over a million monthly unique visitors, the founder and CEO, Yasukane Matsumoto was keen to reinvent a new customer experience for printing with improved transactions, service quality and product offerings. A printing services digital marketplace was launched in 2013, where Raksul took in customers’ printing orders on its online platform and then matched them to the printing companies for fulfillment, assuming full responsibility for service quality, payment settlement and customer support. The startup worked relentlessly to develop the market by partnering with small, medium and large printers alike, enabling them and getting them on onboard. Having successfully disrupted a complex and traditional industry like printing, Raksul saw the scope to expand into other industries. It ventured into logistics by launching its Hacobell B2B e-commerce platform in 2015 and followed that with the launch of Novasell - a digital marketplace for TV commercials in April 2020.\n\nAfter perfecting its platform-based services model for a decade, Raksul now harbors a global ambition, which Yasukane Matsumoto, Founder and CEO says is at the core of the company's founding vision - ‘Better Systems, Better World.’ The setting up of an R&D Center of Excellence India marks the first step in that direction.\n"}},{"contentType":"text","value":{"formats":{"header":3},"data":"Going global amidst a pandemic\n"}},{"contentType":"text","value":{"formats":{},"data":"“It was challenging to ensure a seamless setting up of Raksul’s first overseas office because of the pandemic,” shares Matsumoto. “In February last year, during my visit to India and interactions with Zinnov and various tech companies, I met Sanjay Rajasekhar, who today heads Raksul India. But immediately after, the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic came to the fore.” By April 2020, the weekly revenue from its printing business had slumped considerably, primarily due to the impact of the pandemic. "}},{"contentType":"text","value":{"formats":{"bold":true},"data":"Despite the challenges, Raksul saw opportunities to add new digital services and disrupt the markets further. It had, a month earlier, launched Novasell - a digital B2B platform that streamlines purchasing of television commercial broadcasting slots, analyzing and visualizing the effectiveness of client’s television commercials and thereby democratizing access to TV commercials for businesses."}},{"contentType":"text","value":{"data":"\nSo, it was only natural that the company went ahead with its plan to set up the India Center. “We resumed discussions in June 2020, and we started building the India center soon after”, shares Matsumoto.\n\nWith 11 members already onboard and several more in the pipeline, Raksul India is all set to become a 25-member team soon. Unlike many overseas startups, Raksul India CoE’s role is not just a talent sourcing center. \n"}},{"contentType":"blockquote","value":{"formats":{},"data":"“Given the kind of technology and product development and management talent in India, the India CoE will play a major role in launching and driving the growth for our new, fourth business-line.” says Matsumoto."}},{"contentType":"text","value":{"formats":{},"data":"Given that Raksul India has a prominent role to play in driving the company’s globalization efforts and growth as a global digital platform services provider, Matsumoto doesn’t mince words when he says, “Our selection process is straight-forward but stringent. There is a very high emphasis on the company culture and vision,” he says. “It’s a trust-first culture here at Raksul. There is no scope for micromanagement. It’s all about autonomy, ownership and delivery. This is especially important to deliver on our company vision.” And Matsumoto does walk the talk. He met Sanjay only once before launching the Raksul India - a testament to the trust factor.\n\nInterestingly, Raksul has been able to drive its growth with a lean team. The company’s success has been driven by a core belief that it takes only a small number of people to change the world. And this belief has been translated into action multiple times. However, today Raksul is willing to rewrite that rule. “I have always believed that small teams can do a great job. That’s why our team sizes have traditionally been very small. But today as we plan to go global, I also believe that talent is more important than numbers. The right talent can be the force-multiplier to drive exponential growth.”\n\nIn the last 12 years, Raksul’s team, while growing steadily, has remained lean. Currently it has 350 employees, but that is likely to change in the next few years.

But in a complex and fragmented mobile ecosystem, such links often lead to a broken user experience.\n\nBy leveraging the power of owned media with the help of tools like AppsFlyer’s OneLink, startups can expect their conversion to grow by 2x to 5x through expanded user acquisition, driving engagement and increasing activation rates by providing app users personalised experiences.\n\nMoreover, when owned media channels are leveraged with deep links — which leads users to an app instead of a website — they can create seamless ‘web-to-app’ journeys. When used with an owned media channel like email lists, it can ensure smooth ‘email-to-app’ journeys as well, apart from driving organic growth from social media.\n\nThe problem with using regular links is that it can lead to broken user experience, even in mobile media channels like QR codes and SMS and push notifications. The complex and fragmented nature of the mobile ecosystem requires a third-party technology to ensure that users can access content without any glitches.\n"}},{"contentType":"text","value":{"formats":{"header":3},"data":"Seamless user experience that drives engagement\n"}},{"contentType":"text","value":{"formats":{"list":"bullet"},"data":"Deep linking tools are critical for startups’ growth and their ability to drive user acquisition. As more and more companies expand their digital footprint to grow, they are always looking to attribute and track sources of user traffic — a task that can easily be completed with OneLink. AppsFlyer's OneLink allows marketers to create a single link that can automatically detect each users' platform and app state, i.e. if it's installed or not, and sends them to either the website or app page.\n\nDeep linking is crucial not just for paid media but also for owned media channels like email lists, webpages, and SMS as well. In addition to mobile attribution and deep linking, attribution providers also provide first party audience segmentation, fraud protection, advanced analytics, and, depending on the provider, people-based attribution to connect customer touchpoints across the web, apps, and TV.\n\nAs a cost-effective tool to help startups cash in on the impact of deep linking on owned media channels, OneLink has a host of advantages that digital entrepreneurs would find useful. Some of these are:\n\nSimplifying growth and acquisition with a single link that works with every owned media channel or platform\n"}},{"contentType":"text","value":{"formats":{"list":"bullet"},"data":"Maximises ROI on owned media and engaging users with contextual experiences, which are powered by rich user data contained in deep links\n"}},{"contentType":"text","value":{"formats":{"list":"bullet"},"data":"A powerful trigger point called ‘Smart Banners’.

With OneLink, startups can ensure that they cash in the benefits of zero budget marketing to push user traffic. One of the key ways in which it helps startups implement zero budget marketing strategies is that it simplifies growth and user acquisition with a single link that works on any channel or platform. Next, emerging brands can leverage their assets and maximise their ROI on owned media channels. It also enables personalised onboarding, leaving users delighted with a contextual experience and optimises conversions.\n\nWhether you're an app developer with limited resources or a marketer at a leading brand, the time is right to master the new approach of zero budget marketing via deep linking. Simply put, the success of a startup’s business growth and customer retention strategy may very well depend on the maximisation of owned channels (alongside paid), while significantly minimising marketing costs.\n\nOwned media typically refers to an app’s presence on mediums like social media, email lists, websites, blogs, newsletters and catalogues. When combined with user acquisition tools, owned media channels can help startups drive installations by users who are most likely to engage with the app and generate revenue. However, many startups are often discouraged from fully leveraging the potential of owned media due to broken user journeys.

She believes it is an immensely powerful tool for professionals to create their personal brand. “I don’t think women professionals need to limit themselves to only networking groups with women, although those are critical and deeply empowering, but must use social media to amplify and expand their professional networks overall.

Why this model, why not the other model. Why offline sales? \n\nThose 40 minutes of the meeting gave me much more clarity on the path forward than we had envisioned by ourselves in the last two years. \n\nI hardly knew what was awaiting was a sprint of real transformational events through a series of masterclasses they offer. When we talk about an early-stage investor or a seed-stage investor, they offer more than funding. I am not sure if many people are aware of the real deal with 100X. For startups, 100X’s masterclasses are the real deal. \n\nI remember searching for an industry specialist for getting some guidance for a lot of blind areas where we fumbled, but when your investor offers it in a structured manner, that too one-on-one with industry veterans, you may want to pinch yourself to verify if this is real. \n\nAll of a sudden, we had direct access to a lot of people, and they are available to address your queries instantaneously. Sessions after sessions, our confidence was getting stronger and our vision getting clearer. There are two reasons for it. \n\nFirst, when an industry person talks about what we have envisioned for execution, it confirms our thought process was right. That gives us confidence that we are on the right path. Second, when they share their experience, we see ourselves through that experience, and we can expect what possibly could come up and be prepared.\n\nNot even a single session passed without a great takeaway, and it might be a little overwhelming for a startup in the early stage. I couldn’t imagine that a person like Mitesh Shah was explaining the pricing strategy. \n"}},{"contentType":"blockquote","value":{"formats":{},"data":"“If you start discounting, then that develops into a habit… Have a mid to long-term plan, especially for pricing,” he said."}},{"contentType":"text","value":{"data":"When we designed our pricing, we also outlined our plans for the next 18 months in terms of pricing for each SKUs. This boosted our confidence further.\n\nThe masterclasses cover various verticals of a startup. We have product development sessions, where Venkat Rajan talks about the importance of not overdoing your solution or ensuring you are not solving the wrong problem. \n\nShanti Mohan’s sessions brought in a completely new perspective for the hiring process. We saw a profusion of information in that particular session.\n"}},{"contentType":"blockquote","value":{"formats":{},"data":"“Hire like a startup… Evaluate on potential, measure on attitude, and hire for skill,” she said."}},{"contentType":"text","value":{"data":"While I introspect on that, I realise, since founders work 14-15 hours a day, it will be a complementing to find someone who brings equal work ethics to the table.\n\nIn fact, these sessions are a great way to validate your scale-up plans. Giri Giridhar helped us verify that a higher gross margin gives flexibility and validates our hypothesis. \n"}},{"contentType":"blockquote","value":{"formats":{},"data":"“Allow everyone to be brutal about what works and what not works with your business,” he said."}},{"contentType":"text","value":{"formats":{},"data":"The masterclasses also help redefine your communication with the consumer. I cannot thank Ambi Parameswaran enough, as he listens to each pitch and understands the business, and prompts us to think in terms of brand positioning. That impact was huge. Ambi, you play a crucial role in bringing more clarity to our brand positioning. \n\nWe also had a highly candid and pragmatic session by Vikram Chachra. Now, I tell that story to everyone — “India has a hero culture; so be that hero,” and, of course, the importance of getting rid of all the frictions. \n"}},{"contentType":"alsoRead","value":{"title":"[YS Learn] Focus on building relationships: Top fundraising tips by startup founders for entrepreneurs ","thumbnail":"https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/f02aced0d86311e98e0865c1f0fe59a2/Funding-1587044486257.png?fm=png&auto=format&h=100&w=100&crop=entropy&fit=crop","publishedUrl":"https://yourstory.com/2021/03/ys-learn-fundraising-tips-startup-founders-shan-kadavil-karan-bajaj"}},{"contentType":"text","value":{"formats":{"header":2},"data":"Funding lessons\n"}},{"contentType":"text","value":{"data":"Entrepreneurs know the business or product aspect well.

When Ravindra Krishnappa outlined the VCs story and how they work, that prompted all of us to realign ourselves. \n\nWhile Vishesh Rajaram reinstates the point that successful companies hire really well, he reminded us that we need to hire twice better. \n\nThe fundraising session was highly informative for startups starting to raise funds.

While that is a distant dream, I can't explain how much elated we were when talking to KRS Jamwal, listening to his viewpoints about our business. \n\nInvestors have a thesis and a framework in their mind for a startup evaluation.

The two companies were launched around the same time, but in different cities — one in Indore, the other in Bhopal.\n\nBoth startups had a fairly similar beginning. Post their launch they were able to get some traction — after all, beauty is big business and in today’s world, no one wants to put chemicals on the skin. Or worse, swallow these chemicals. Friends and relatives of the founders visited the sites, liked the products, and started buying them.

"}},{"contentType":"text","value":{"formats":{},"data":"\nNow you must remember both these companies were B2C (business to consumer). To scale up, B2C companies need to spend heavily on marketing, whether through Facebook, Amazon, or Google ad words. But here the founders faced a problem.

And both of them pitched to the same angel network. Of course, you must have guessed by now that both of them were asked to pitch their startups to the angels on the same day.\n\nThe angels around the table liked both the presentations. The two founders were passionate and knowledgeable about their businesses. In keeping with the parallel stories of the two startups, the angels decided to invest in both. After all, they wanted to hedge their bets. If one collapsed, hopefully the other one would get them the returns they wanted.\n\nThe only issue was valuation. “Not enough traction,” “We need to see a lot more revenues”, “Are these customers sticky?” were some of the statements made by the investors. Anyway, they did decide to invest, but only at a pre-funding valuation of Rs 3 crore.\n\nAs you can imagine, both founders were aghast: Rs 3 crore? What a pittance! Still, they decided to meet in the evening for a chat to figure out what to do. Now, this is where the story takes a twist.\n"}},{"contentType":"alsoRead","value":{"title":"How Much Equity Should You Dilute?\r\n\r\n","thumbnail":"https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/f02aced0d86311e98e0865c1f0fe59a2/shutterstock313380698-1611914614004.jpg?fm=png&auto=format&h=100&w=100&crop=entropy&fit=crop","publishedUrl":"https://yourstory.com/2021/01/startup-funding-equity-dilution"}},{"contentType":"text","value":{"formats":{},"data":"For the first time, the twins decided on completely different approaches to running their respective businesses. Seeta realised that a marketplace of the kind she was running would not have a significant entry barrier. After all, anyone could start something similar. \n\nThe only way she could build such a barrier was by scaling up rapidly and building a brand. But for this, she desperately needed funds. The problem was the valuation. If she were to raise Rs 1.5 crore at a valuation of Rs 3 crore, that would mean a dilution of 33 percent of equity. That would be a disaster: too much dilution, with future investors unlikely to invest. No, that would definitely not do.\n\nBut Seeta needed the money. Being a quick decision-maker, she sought to raise the money at the valuation the angels were offering. But not the entire Rs 1.5 crore — she only raised half that amount, or Rs 75 lakh. This meant she was diluting 20 percent of her equity, not 33 percent.\n\nGeeta, on the other hand, was not convinced. “No, the valuation is too low. I’ll continue to bootstrap. Maybe I’ll grow a bit slower, but I refuse to take money at this miserable valuation.” And so the twins said bye to each other and went their separate ways for once.\n\nBut wait. That’s not the end of the story. Cut to a year later. Seeta was able to use the money to scale up the business. The market liked her offering and she grew quite dramatically. Within a year, she was back with the same bunch of investors, seeking more funds to grow further. \n\nOf course, you can guess what the investors said. They were delighted with the company’s growth and this time they agreed to put in more funds at a valuation of — hold your breath – Rs 12 crore.\n\nSeeta was delighted. She happily accepted the money and continued to grow. In fact, she now expanded beyond Madhya Pradesh into neighbouring Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Her brand was definitely getting built. When I last met her, Seeta was an extremely satisfied young woman running a rapidly growing business.\n\nBut what about Geeta? Well, without funds she plodded along, unable to spend on marketing and, therefore, unable to get too much traction. In fact, at a particular stage she realised she was beginning to stagnate. Frustrated, she had to shut down the business.\n\nThat’s a lesson for you, my friend. If you do not have any significant entry barrier, you have no choice but to grow rapidly and build your brand. For this, you will need large marketing spends and, therefore, funding, especially if you are in a B2C business.\n\nIf that is the case, please take the money — even if you don’t like the valuation. You could even take less money than you had planned to. But do take it. Use it to grow your business. Once that happens, valuations will auto-correct and you can raise more money later at a significantly higher valuation.\n\nSo that’s the lesson for today. But before I end, I have a request. Geeta is looking for a job. She’s a hard-working person, so if you have an opportunity where she can fit in, do let me know. I’ll put her in touch with you.\n"}}],"timeLapsed":"17th Mar 2021","publishedDate":"March 17, 2021"},{"id":194576,"title":"Demand gen Vs lead gen: What’s in it for SaaS enterprises?\n\n","slug":"demand-gen-vs-lead-gen-saas-enterprises","type":"RICH","subtitle":"Many sales and marketing teams confuse lead generation with demand generation – they use many of the same tools and resources to reach their goals.

To attract funders and customers, entrepreneurs need to build a clear and unique narrative that highlights how the profitability of their enterprise (which may seem surprising to some) is directly tied to its environmental, cultural, and social impact. For example, entrepreneurs that work with farmers should be ready to tell how their products have directly improved the livelihoods, food security, and health of their customers and employees.\n\nEntrepreneurs also have to communicate consistently with their customers, especially when their products are only available during certain seasons. This is especially true for companies like Bastar Se Bazar Tak, which works with 250 tribal farmers in Chattisgarh to grow custard apple (sitaphal), palash flower, tamarind (imli) and black plum (jamun) for the market. The company’s founder, Satendra Lilhare, has learned that he has to explain to customers why the availability of his products is tied to the natural cycle of the seasons – or risk losing business.\n"}},{"contentType":"text","value":{"formats":{"header":2},"data":"3.

However, these organisations tend to be under-funded, making it hard for entrepreneurs to access smallholder farmers through them.\n\nAccording to Deepthi Reddy, the CEO of the Samunnati Foundation, seed capital from foundations, the government, and the private sector can come in to boost the efficacy of FPOs and FPCs. When these organisations receive technical and financial support, they can link smallholder farmers to the products and services that budding restoration entrepreneurs are selling, which, in turn, can help them build stronger rural livelihoods while protecting the environment.

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is a network that enables financial institutions to send and receive information about financial transactions in a secure environment.\n\nAt SWIFT, we actively support the global financial community in the fight against cyber-attacks by fostering a more secure financial ecosystem, Shetty said.\n\nHe said SWIFT's solutions such as Payment Controls System allows banks to mitigate fraudulent attacks by monitoring transactions on a real-time basis and detecting these potentially high risk transactions, alerting the teams and combined with the ability to block payments and transactions, prevents cybercrimes.\n\nShetty said SWIFT also runs a customer security program which its members need to follow. There are 31 principles to protect the environment in which SWIFT infrastructure operates.\n\nKhara said products from SWIFT have added to the transparency for customers, both in terms of tracking the status of various payments and the transaction costs.\n\nHe said going forward, digitisation is more likely a default option as the bank serves a variety of customers in different geographies but physical branches will remain.\n\nIt is not an 'either-or' situation.

Blue Sky Analytics, a data intelligence startup, leverages satellite data and AI to generate environmental datasets across a range of air, land, and water parameters.\n\n“Funds across categories are looking at startups that are sustainable, and that doesn’t mean they function with no business models or revenues.

The companies in this space explore how supply chains can work differently, and constantly strive towards reduced waste generation on farm produce. \n\nAnup Jain, Managing Partner at Orios Venture Partners, explains “Climate change and its adverse impact is being recognised globally.

I saved a few thousand rupees and bought a tattoo machine, without knowing how to put the needle in the machine,” he says. \n\nLokesh tried his first tattoo on his retired Army soldier father. “I was always into drawing skulls and crossbones.
