How master.css file is structured

base.css -&gt; Foundational Styles
breadcrumbs.css -&gt; Breadcrumbs at the top of pages
custom.css -&gt; Style that we have written, or customized outside of the bootstrap libraries
admissions-steps.css -&gt; Steps timeline on the /admissions page
two-factor-authentication.css -&gt; All styles applied specifically to the two factor login page
breakpoints.css -&gt; Media Query breakpoints for all devices except internet explorer live here
internet-explorer.css -&gt; Specific styles for Internet Explorer

All global styles must exist in the css/components directory and be imported into the master.css file.

Any Future files imported will change the order for which files need to be loaded.
