             From acclaimed writer/director Miranda July comes a profoundly moving and wildly original comedy. Con-artists Theresa (Debra Winger) and Robert (Richard Jenkins) have spent 26 years training their only daughter, Old Dolio (Evan Rachel Wood), to swindle, scam, and steal at every opportunity. During a desperate, hastily conceived heist, they charm a stranger (Gina Rodriguez) into joining their next scam, only to have their entire world turned upside down.

The timeless story powerfully explores the capacity for love that surges through the human heart, while illuminating the lavish society that was imperial Russia. The time is 1874. Vibrant and beautiful, Anna Karenina (Ms. Knightley) has what any of her contemporaries would aspire to; she is the wife of Karenin (Jude Law), a high-ranking government official to whom she has borne a son, and her social standing in St. Petersburg could scarcely be higher. She journeys to Moscow after a letter from her philandering brother Oblonsky (Matthew Macfadyen) arrives, asking for Anna to come and help save his marriage to Dolly (Kelly Macdonald). En route, Anna makes the acquaintance of Countess Vronsky (Olivia Williams), who is then met at the train station by her son, the dashing cavalry officer Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). When Anna is introduced to Vronsky, there is a mutual spark of instant attraction that cannot &ndash; and will not &ndash; be ignored.<\/p><p>The Moscow household is also visited by Oblonsky&rsquo;s best friend Levin (Domhnall Gleeson), an overly sensitive and compassionate landowner. Levin is in love with Dolly&rsquo;s younger sister Kitty (Alicia Vikander). Inopportunely, he proposes to Kitty but she is infatuated with Vronsky. Devastated, Levin returns to his Pokrovskoe estate and throws himself into farm work.

She attempts to resume her familial&nbsp;routine,&nbsp;but is consumed by thoughts of Vronsky. A passionate affair ensues, which scandalizes St. Petersburg society. Karenin is placed in an untenable position and is forced to give his wife an ultimatum. In attempting to attain happiness, the decisions Anna makes pierce the veneer of an image-obsessed society, reverberating with romantic and tragic consequences that dramatically change her and the lives of all around her.<\/p>","date_results":"OWN IT NOW","date_ob":"2012-11-16","production_status":3,"color":"#e03c34","color2":"","ticketing_desc":"","footer_img":"","grid_img":"filmgrid_1477409500.jpg","hasposts":1,"columns":1,"division":"focus_features","rank":128},{"id":"for_a_good_time_call","num_id":99,"production_title":"For A Good Time, Call...","trailer_url":"","fandango_id":"","other_ticket":"","poster":"","in_theaters":"<p>August 31, 2012<\/p>","short_desc":"<p>Love and friendship are on the line in&nbsp;<strong><em>For a Good Time, Call&hellip;<\/em><\/strong>, directed by Jamie Travis from an original screenplay by Katie Anne Naylon &amp; Lauren Anne Miller.

His film career started in 1956, at the oddest of places: poolside at the Beverly Hills Hotel. His good looks, charm, and overwhelming confidence captured the eye of screen legend Norma Shearer. She offered him a role in the picture \"Man of a Thousand Faces.\" After a glamorous, but short-lived, career as a movie star, Evans decided to try his hand at producing. Miraculously, at the age of 34, with no producing credits to his name, he landed a job as chief of production at Paramount Pictures. Evans ran the studio from 1966-1974. During his tenure, Evans was responsible for bringing some of the greatest films of the era to the screen, including \"The Godfather,\" \"Rosemary's Baby,\" \"Love Story,\" \"The Odd Couple,\" \"The Conformist,\" \"Harold and Maude,\" and \"Chinatown.\"<\/p><p>By the early '80s, the \"Golden Boy\" of Hollywood was losing his luster. After a failed marriage to Ali MacGraw, a cocaine bust, and, finally, a rumored involvement in the \"Cotton Club\" murder, Evans disappeared into near-obscurity. Only through tremendous will and uncanny luck did he once again rise as \"the kid who stays in the picture.\"<\/p><p>Through the years, Evans's closest friends have included Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, Roman Polanski, Henry Kissinger, and Dustin Hoffman. Long considered one of Tinseltown's most enduring bachelors, Evans has enjoyed meaningful love affairs with some of the most beautiful women of the past half-century, including Ava Gardner, Grace Kelly, Lana Turner, Ali MacGraw, Cheryl Tiegs, Raquel Welch, and Margaux Hemingway.&nbsp;<strong><em>The Kid Stays in the Picture<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;shares gripping anecdotes about Evans's unusual friendships and follows the thread of his tumultuous love life.<\/p><p><strong><em>The Kid Stays in the Picture<\/em><\/strong>&nbsp;is narrated by Mr. Evans in his distinctive voice and storytelling manner.

classic TV series comes Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie - one of the most outrageous, most irreverent, and most hilarious big-screen spoofs ever! A mad scientist, in his quest for world domination, concocts a diabolical scheme to subject the human race to the worst movie ever made: 1955's This Island Earth. It's up to one test subject's quick wit, sharp sense of humor, and utter intolerance for cinematic garbage to foil the plans of the scientist and to save the Earth.
