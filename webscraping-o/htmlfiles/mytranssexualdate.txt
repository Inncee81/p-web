    MyTransSexualDate.org: What Does Transgender Mean?
   </h2>
   <p>
    Transgender dating sites have become incredibly popular. Transgender people are the kind of persons living with a different gender from the one they were born with. This relates to people whose personal identity does not correspond to their birth sex. This is an umbrella term that defines people living with a different gender from the one they were assigned at birth.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some of these transgender people are identified as non-binary or queer, meaning they neither belong to males or females. An example of this is a person identified as a woman but has been born as a man with male genitals.
   </p>
   <p>
    Some of these people end up transforming their bodies to match their identified gender and also change their birth names and dressing style to suit the present gender.
   </p>
   <p>
    When you have a different gender identified at birth, but you are no longer living with it, then you are a transgender person. Welcome to MyTransSexualDate.org — here, you will find the list of the best transsexual dating sites, according to US users’ reviews.

    Transgender and Transsexual: What’s the Difference?
   </h2>
   <p>
    As defined above, transgender means a person living with the kind of gender they were not born with. It can be someone born as a woman but living as a man or vice versa.
   </p>
   <p>
    When it comes to transsexuals, these are people who have converted their sex through surgery. They are a part of the transgender group that has sought medical assistance to transform themselves from one sex to another, most done through plastic surgery.
   </p>
   <p>
    The only significant difference between these two terms is, transgender is a general umbrella term for people living with a different gender from the initial. At the same time, transsexuals go through medical procedures to make their sex and gender match.
   </p>
   <p>
    Transsexuals, as well as transgender people, are a part of the LGBTQ community.
   </p>
   <h2 class="xtsUl34a" id="should-you-come-out-as-transgender-to-your-online-date">
    Should You Come Out as Transgender to Your Online Date?
   </h2>
   <p>
    Transgender people often face a lot of challenges when it comes to online dating. Most online dating websites have not considered this group, and in most cases, you will not find this type of sexuality in their gender or sexual orientation section.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is always advisable for transgender to come out honestly about their sex and gender and, at the same time, remain careful. Revealing such things should not be done right away. They need to understand their partner first, know what they like, and raise issues concerning this gender before going forward to mention it.
   </p>
   <p>
    You should always try to clarify your new interlocutor’s opinion about the LGBTQ community, and, especially Trans persons. This is because most people tend to reject this side of life and opt for more traditional relations. Just be open before someone makes long term plans with you. Tell them how you are coming through the challenges and how far you have come with it.
   </p>

When talking to people online, don’t trust anyone with your bank details, address, phone number, and even full name. Keep your private information to yourself, and if somebody asks about it, consider staying away from this person. Use a blocking function if any user makes you feel unsafe. Report fraudsters and those who send spam; by doing this, you’ll help the platform remain safe and friendly.
