TALL KNIGHT

       We are the keepers of the sacred words.  NI ... Peng ... and Neee

       ... Wom!



                               BEDEVERE

       Those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale.



                               TALL KNIGHT

       The Knights Who Say 'Ni'! demand a sacrifice.



                               ARTHUR

           (to the TALL KNIGHT)

       Knights Who Say 'Ni' ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the

       Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...



                               TALL KNIGHT

       NI!



                               ARTHUR

           (recoiling)

       Oh!



                               TALL KNIGHT

       NI!   NI!



                               ARTHUR

           (he cowers in fear)

       Oh!
