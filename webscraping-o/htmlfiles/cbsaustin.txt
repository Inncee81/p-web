Parts of Mason, Llano, Burnet, Williamson, and Milam counties are now included in a very isolated threat for large hail and damaging wind gusts. More shifts in this forecast are possible through this afternoon, so be sure to check back for updates. {\/strong}{\/p}<p><strong>ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN THIS WEEK{\/strong}{\/p}<p>After a spectacular start to the spring season this weekend, a pair of disturbances through\/near the Lone Star State will put storm chances back in the forecast, though rain is far from a guarantee for everyone over the next 5 days. Here&rsquo;s what to expect:{\/p}<p><strong>MONDAY NIGHT: STORMS POSSIBLE, SOME STRONG{\/strong}{\/p}<p>The first storm system will bring a front through Texas late tonight\/early tomorrow morning, though due to the main lift in the atmosphere staying well to our north, coverage of storms tonight is expected to be minimal\/displaced to the north.{\/p}<p>Most of the day Monday will be dry with just a cloudy scene, breezy winds, and building humidity with highs in the low to mid 70s. Storms pop off in west Texas by late afternoon and begin their march to the east between then and midnight. These storms will pack large hail, damaging wind gusts, and an isolated tornado threat for North Texas tonight.{\/p}<p>This far south, it looks like our atmosphere will be &ldquo;capped&rdquo; meaning it will be difficult for storms to get off the ground and become intense locally. The storm coverage in\/around Austin is low as a result at around 30% with slightly higher chances to the north of Austin.{\/p}<p><strong>WORD OF CAUTION: {\/strong}IF our local atmosphere becomes more unstable than we currently anticipate, then we may have a severe weather threat to contend with. Stay tuned to the forecast and don&rsquo;t be surprised if the set-up changes significantly by this evening.{\/p}<p><strong>ANOTHER STORM WEDNESDAY NIGHT{\/strong}{\/p}<p>Tuesday will be a dry and warm day behind front #1 with highs in the mid-80s. Moisture quickly returns to Central Texas by Wednesday afternoon with a few light showers possible.{\/p}<p>Another front arrives late Wednesday through early Thursday, though the main storm system will once again be displaced too far to the north for our rain chances to be higher than about 40%. Severe weather will be unlikely on this occasion, too.{\/p}<p>Put both storm chances together and there could be some isolated rain totals over half an inch, though most will have less than a quarter of an inch of rain in the bucket by Thursday morning. It&rsquo;s likely that drought will NOT improve this week.{\/p}<p>We are dry and warm with highs in the 70s and 80s through the coming weekend. Rain chances return early NEXT week. Stay tuned for updates!{\/p}<p><strong>ALLERGY REPORT | MONDAY{\/strong}{\/p}<p>Oak: 822 - high. Hackberry: 428 - high. Ash: 66 - mod. Mulberry: 33 - mod. Other trees: 22 - mod. Grass: 4 - low.

Parts of Mason, Llano, Burnet, Williamson, and Milam counties are now included in a very isolated threat for large hail and damaging wind gusts. More shifts in this forecast are possible through this afternoon, so be sure to check back for updates. {\/strong}{\/p}<p><strong>ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN THIS WEEK{\/strong}{\/p}<p>After a spectacular start to the spring season this weekend, a pair of disturbances through\/near the Lone Star State will put storm chances back in the forecast, though rain is far from a guarantee for everyone over the next 5 days. Here&rsquo;s what to expect:{\/p}<p><strong>MONDAY NIGHT: STORMS POSSIBLE, SOME STRONG{\/strong}{\/p}<p>The first storm system will bring a front through Texas late tonight\/early tomorrow morning, though due to the main lift in the atmosphere staying well to our north, coverage of storms tonight is expected to be minimal\/displaced to the north.{\/p}<p>Most of the day Monday will be dry with just a cloudy scene, breezy winds, and building humidity with highs in the low to mid 70s. Storms pop off in west Texas by late afternoon and begin their march to the east between then and midnight. These storms will pack large hail, damaging wind gusts, and an isolated tornado threat for North Texas tonight.{\/p}<p>This far south, it looks like our atmosphere will be &ldquo;capped&rdquo; meaning it will be difficult for storms to get off the ground and become intense locally. The storm coverage in\/around Austin is low as a result at around 30% with slightly higher chances to the north of Austin.{\/p}<p><strong>WORD OF CAUTION: {\/strong}IF our local atmosphere becomes more unstable than we currently anticipate, then we may have a severe weather threat to contend with. Stay tuned to the forecast and don&rsquo;t be surprised if the set-up changes significantly by this evening.{\/p}<p><strong>ANOTHER STORM WEDNESDAY NIGHT{\/strong}{\/p}<p>Tuesday will be a dry and warm day behind front #1 with highs in the mid-80s. Moisture quickly returns to Central Texas by Wednesday afternoon with a few light showers possible.{\/p}<p>Another front arrives late Wednesday through early Thursday, though the main storm system will once again be displaced too far to the north for our rain chances to be higher than about 40%. Severe weather will be unlikely on this occasion, too.{\/p}<p>Put both storm chances together and there could be some isolated rain totals over half an inch, though most will have less than a quarter of an inch of rain in the bucket by Thursday morning. It&rsquo;s likely that drought will NOT improve this week.{\/p}<p>We are dry and warm with highs in the 70s and 80s through the coming weekend. Rain chances return early NEXT week. Stay tuned for updates!{\/p}<p><strong>ALLERGY REPORT | MONDAY{\/strong}{\/p}<p>Oak: 822 - high. Hackberry: 428 - high. Ash: 66 - mod. Mulberry: 33 - mod. Other trees: 22 - mod. Grass: 4 - low.
