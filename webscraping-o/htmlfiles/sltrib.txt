started his journalism career at age 8, banging out stories on his parents’ manual typewriter about Little League sports and video games. It wasn’t until years later that he went to work for The Associated Press and actually started getting paid for it. He has spent more than 20 years primarily covering government and politics in Utah and the West, including seven years in Washington, D.C. He joined The Salt Lake Tribune in 2004. His work on the Crandall Canyon coal mine collapse in 2007 was praised by a U.S. Senate committee investigating the disaster and he collaborated on an investigation into corruption in the Utah Attorney General’s office in 2012-14 that forced the attorney general to resign. Since January, he has transitioned into a role as a political columnist. He enjoys hiking with his dogs and two children and rooting for hopeless underdogs in every sport.","bio":"Robert has spent more than 20 years primarily covering government and politics in Utah and the West, including seven years in Washington, D.C.","pinterest":"News columnist","custom_sltrib_phone":"801-257-8730","books":[],"podcasts":[],"education":[],"awards":[],"last_updated_date":"2020-12-03T23:05:21.625Z"}}}]},"first_publish_date":"2021-03-21T12:00:01.961Z","websites":{"sltrib":{"website_section":{"_id":"/news/health","_website":"sltrib","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Health","description":"Salt Lake Tribune health coverage for Salt Lake City and the surrounding area.","path":"/news/health","parent_id":"/news","parent":{"default":"/news"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/news/health","site":{"site_url":"https://www.sltrib.com/news/health/","site_title":"Health","site_tagline":null,"site_about":null,"site_description":"Salt Lake Tribune health coverage for Salt Lake City and the surrounding area.","site_keywords":"Health","native_app_rendering":null,"pagebuilder_path_for_native_apps":"/news/health/"},"social":{"twitter":null,"facebook":null,"rss":null,"archives":null},"_admin":{"tracking_node":null,"default_content":null,"alias_ids":["/news/health"],"commercial_node":null},"story_list":{"story_list_content":{}},"navigation":{"nav_title":null,"display_in_top_strip":null,"nav_display":null},"in_the_news":{"in_the_news_usebasepage":"/in-the-news-forsections/","in_the_news_usesectionbar":"false","in_the_news_usefeature":null},"_website":"sltrib","name":"Health","order":{"default":2008,"Mobile":2004},"parent":{"default":"/news","Mobile":"/news"},"ancestors":{"default":["/news"],"Mobile":["/news"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section"}},"_website_section_id":"sltrib./news/health"},"website_url":"/news/health/2021/03/21/robert-gehrke-what-will"}},"additional_properties":{"clipboard":{},"has_published_copy":true},"publish_date":"2021-03-21T12:00:03.058Z","slug":"gehrke.032121","publishing":{"scheduled_operations":{"publish_edition":[],"unpublish_edition":[]}},"website":"sltrib","website_url":"/news/health/2021/03/21/robert-gehrke-what-will"},"expires":1616359627582,"lastModified":1616359327582}},"arc-stories-search":{"{\"criteria\":\"\",\"offset\":6,\"section\":\"/news\",\"size\":3,\"sort\":\"display_date:desc\"}":{"data":{"content_elements":[{"_id":"7TON3WAAE5HYXJNCA3UCWIE7II","canonical_url":"/news/2021/03/20/university-utah-under","content_elements":[{"content":"The University of Utah is under fire from an animal rights group over United States Department of Agriculture inspection reports that say laboratory monkeys died of “overheating and distress” in their cages and after surgical procedures.","type":"text"},{"content":"Michael Budkie, the head of Ohio-based animal welfare nonprofit Stop Animal Exploitation Now, which advocates against animal experiments, called inspection reports issued to the University of Utah disturbing.

If you look at the college basketball landscape from a macro perspective, there were 18 Division I head coaching positions open as of Thursday morning. Harlan has on his hands the second-most attractive job out of those 18, behind only perceived blueblood Indiana University.","type":"text"},{"content":"In discussing Krystkowiak’s dismissal and Utah’s head coaching position in general with The Salt Lake Tribune on Wednesday evening, one West Coast-based assistant coach called the school’s basketball program a “sleeping giant.” That choice of words is interesting because it offers two different perspectives. On one hand, a proverbial sleeping giant has not reached its potential and has not accomplished anything of real merit. On the other hand, the perception of a proverbial sleeping giant is that it remains capable of great things.","type":"text"},{"content":"Calling Utah a “sleeping giant” is apropos because objectively, there are perfectly valid reasons to believe this basketball program could, even should return to prominence.","type":"text"},{"content":"When Utah joined the Pac-12 in 2011, it tried to dive into the <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=3015970&itype=CMSID\">facilities arms race</a>. To that end, the 90,000-square foot <a href=\"https://uteathletics.com/facilities/huntsman-basketball-facility.html\">Huntsman Basketball Facility</a> is the crown jewel of those efforts over the past decade. That building, which sits adjacent to the Huntsman Center, should be a massive selling point to recruits.","type":"text"},{"content":"There are certain college basketball arenas that are considered cathedrals of the sport, Rupp Arena, The Palestra, Assembly Hall, Hinkle Fieldhouse among them. The Huntsman Center generally does not get that designation, but the truth of the matter is, the 15,000-seat, 51-year old building is iconic, and should also work in a coach’s favor in trying to sell the program. Remember, the Huntsman Center hosted one of the most-famous college basketball games ever, the 1979 national championship game between Larry Bird’s Indiana State and Magic Johnson’s Michigan State, and many other great NCAA Tournament moments in the ensuing years.","type":"text"},{"content":"Fan support eroded in recent years amid a succession of mediocre finishes, but when the Utes have it rolling, the fan base will show up at the <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/utah-utes/2020/04/17/university-utahs-huntsman/\">Huntsman Center</a>.

It was 12,051 in 2017, 11,710 in 2018, 11,393 in 2019, and 10,561 in 2020.

During the 2019-20 season, Krystkowiak assistants Tommy Connor, Andy Hill and Henry Martinez combined to make almost $830,000 according to their employment contracts, which were obtained by The Tribune. Connor, the program’s associate head coach, made roughly $443,000 that season.","type":"text"},{"content":"“Chris’ reasoning all those years ago was that Larry was doing a hell of a job, the program was rolling, people were nipping at Larry’s heels, and Chris was afraid he might get away,” said a person with knowledge of the situation, who asked to remain anonymous so as not to compromise relationships with Hill and Krystkowiak. “As time went on, what [Krystkowiak] was putting out on the floor didn’t match the investment.”","type":"text"},{"content":"Hill declined to be interviewed by The Tribune for this story.","type":"text"},{"content":"As mediocrity permeated the program in the seasons after the NCAA Tournament trips, the contract, and more specifically the buyout attached to it, became a point of contention. This situation is not exclusive to Utah, a highly paid coach having an exorbitant buyout, which may have staved off being terminated earlier.","type":"text"},{"content":"That is now a subplot of this coaching search, not only how much the next guy gets paid, but who pays it. In an athletic department statement on Tuesday announcing Krystkowiak’s firing, Utah said “the costs associated with this termination and the hiring of a new head coach and staff will be fully funded from athletically-generated resources.”","type":"text"},{"content":"What exactly “athletically-generated resources” means is up for debate, but if there is going to he high-level booster/donor help in paying the next coach, that would qualify as another plus for Utah basketball.

Conversely, those same people are willing to pay to get rid of a poor product.","type":"text"},{"content":"“Certain guys have certain juice, and it’s always that way up there,” the same person with knowledge wishing to remain anonymous told The Tribune. “There are boosters there willing to pay to get something done.

McKay and his counselors clarified that temple ordinances could not be performed for Black people even if they were dead. The policy was that any deceased person could be baptized or endowed,<a href=\"http://www.todayinmormonhistory.com/2016/08/50-years-ago-today-aug-15-1966.html\"> “except those of known Negro blood, without the consideration of worthiness or any other qualification.”</a> In other words, a murderer or rapist who had had white skin in life could still receive temple ordinances, but no people with black skin could, regardless of their righteousness.)","type":"text"},{"content":"Other temple policies and practices that I would venture to guess no one misses include two gems from Brigham Young’s time: that a man “should not touch a woman for 10 days” before receiving his endowment, and that a <a href=\"https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=53650972&itype=cmsid\">woman “should not go for a week after her menses </a>were upon her.”","type":"text"},{"content":"My point is that temple rituals have evolved.

In fact, the first time I ever heard about them being performed in the Salt Lake Temple was from a friend who was explaining that this mode of the endowment had helped her to understand more fully that the ritual is intended to be symbolic, not literal. There was something about seeing Adam and Eve being portrayed by a silver-haired couple in their late 80s that made her realize: Oh. We are all Adam. We are all Eve. I am part of this story, too.","type":"text"},{"content":"That realization was not something that came to her when she sat passively watching the temple film, with its slicker presentation and attractive, young actors.
