        <h2>
         We offer: Theme Installation for our WP Themes at your web hosting FREE OF COST
        </h2>
        <p>
         The main and the very basic problem that everyone faces is that after purchasing a theme one has to find and browse through various tutorials or contact at Support and wait for them to reply back till you have any other query.
        </p>
        <p>
         Hence in SKT WP Themes we tend to remove this barrier and will upload and set up any theme you purchase FREE OF COST in your server/hosting account you select.
        </p>
        <p>
         All you need to do is to send us cPanel/hosting details while purchasing and we take care of the rest.
        </p>
        <p>
         Alternatively if you are a developer and do not wish to share the details with us. Its fine, you anyways get the XML sample data as well as the MySQL dump along with the files of the WordPress theme.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our other features included with each and every theme are:
        </p>
        <h3>
         Theme Options
        </h3>
        <p>
         Whenever you buy a theme you think that it should be very easy to change colors or change the fonts, font sizes, header and footer text, add google analytics codes etc.
        </p>
        <p>
         Well we made these things easier by adding Theme options in all of our professional WordPress themes.
        </p>
        <p>
         So with each SKT WP Theme you get to easily change the colors, typography, header /footer elements like logo, and contact info as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         These easy and customizable options make you think as a theme rockstar and also gets your job done well as you don’t have to explain to much to your client or have to dig much for yourself.
        </p>
        <h3>
         Skins
        </h3>
        <p>
         With every professional WordPress theme you at least get 1 skin to change the pattern as well as background, colors and look and feel of your theme.
        </p>
        <p>
         This serves as an added benefit. So in case you don’t want to waste too much time adjusting and setting up color schemes for your theme just pick up the theme and check the colors available and see for yourself in demo.
        </p>
        <p>
         Select the theme which suits you the best. And here you go. All you now have to do is enter the content and launch your website.
        </p>
        <h3>
         Widgets to ease you out
        </h3>
        <p>
         Widgets form a very important part of WordPress CMS. Be it a simple text in the middle of a page which takes up an odd area or be it anything in sidebar or just below a slider area. Widgets always come handy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Also for affiliate themes and for WP themes that are Ads Ready, widgets play a quintessential part.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our each and every theme come with a host of widgets to ease you out so that for areas which look odd or for areas where you want a little different text/content/functionality different than the rest of the site widget come into play.
        </p>
        <p>
         Be it PHP widgets or content widgets we have all of them in place in our WP themes.
        </p>
        <h3>
         Responsive
        </h3>
        <p>
         In today’s world mobiles and tablets have become a part of our daily life so much that there are many people who do shopping, internet browsing, checking emails or chatting with friends on Facebook from their mobile phones.
        </p>
        <p>
         So it is a point to be noted that they may visit your website as well using their smart phones or tablets. And you don’t want to lose them just because your website isn’t response.
        </p>
        <p>
         Not anymore. Our each and every premium theme is Responsive so that Tablets, mobiles and of course Desktop users can easily browse through your website.
        </p>
        <h3>
         Shortcodes
        </h3>
        <p>
         Just as widgets are important to place content anywhere on the site shortcodes are an essential part of any professional WordPress theme.
        </p>
        <p>
         So in case you just want to embed a video, or audio or place simple buttons for call to action, have a 2-3 column structure in the middle of your web page or have a pre-styled blockquote or pre-styled content box for differently presenting your content you just need a shortcode.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our each theme comes with a set of preset shortcodes which make your life quite easier in the process of building a website.
        </p>
        <h3>
         Documentation
        </h3>
        <p>
         No matter how much we show in the demo or no matter even if we install the theme on to your hosting there are times in future when you need a quick answer to some queries about the premium WordPress theme functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
         That time Documentation plays an important part.
        </p>
        <p>
         You need to know if a certain kind of shortcode is present or whether a widget can be used in a certain area or if you are a developer and wish to create more templates or copy some functionality from one place to another you just need to know how to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Every time visiting the support forum, writing a question and patiently waiting for an answer is also not the solution.
        </p>
        <p>
         Hence we have well documented manuals free of cost with each theme available so that you don’t have to wait for an answer for each and everything after you purchase a theme.
        </p>
        <h3>
         Access to Support Forum, Email and Skype
        </h3>

         Also there should be modern and futuristic features so that one can add useful functions easily into the website without waiting for someone to add them. So on your own one can easily add any feature or functionality.
        </p>
        <h3>
         Here are some of the more modern and futuristic features at par with other theme providers:
        </h3>
        <p>
         <strong>
          1. Elementor based latest WP themes:
         </strong>
         Elementor is future as has been advocated by WordPress dot org team and has been recommended to be used for default approach and hassle free guidelines to any user.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because every user right now needs to find the right place where theme is being edited from in customizer everyone would know where the theme is managed from. Also Customizer allows a great live experience for users to view all the changes made live.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          2. Compatible with recommended page builders:
         </strong>
         Page builders are proving to be the best assistive technology for users who don’t have much experience with coding and hence they can add any fancy layout and features all at the click of few buttons using page builders.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some pages builders explicitly and out of the box work with all WordPress themes provided by SKT and hence they make life of users easier.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          3. Font based social icons:
         </strong>
         Font based social icons have 2 easy advantages: First one being that there are more than 800+ icons that can be used through out the website and second one that since these are font based icons one can easily change their sizes as well as colors easily using CSS or directly via theme options.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          4. Unlimited possibilities of colors:
         </strong>
         With color picker it has become so easier for any user to change colors of any elements you see on the entire website. So independent of any element different color schemes can be used at various points.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          5. Page templates:
         </strong>
         Several page templates are included and also blog templates are included so that sidebar layout can be managed and maintained easily all through out the website.
        </p>

         </strong>
         eCommerce of any website can be easily managed and created using
         <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
          WooCommerce plugin
         </a>
         which has been now part of the core WordPress team and hence it is becoming increasingly easier for eCommerce to be added to any website out of the box as all our themes work with WooCommerce by default.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          7. Responsive and HD ready:
         </strong>
         Responsive is now life of all websites as more and more smartphone users are increasing and they are accessing web via their smartphones and mobile phones and other hand held devices like tablets.
