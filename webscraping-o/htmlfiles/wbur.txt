She’s the administrator at the Alliance Health at Rosewood nursing home in Peabody, where most employees were able to get fully vaccinated thanks to CVS and the state Department of Public Health, which set up vaccine clinics at the home on three separate occasions.","But, she says, some of her employees only made it to the third and final clinic.","“We had a few who decided at the very end that 'yes, I definitely want this vaccine.' Two were actually sick with COVID during the first two clinics, so they had to wait until the third,” McPherson says.","She promised that she’d be able to get them second doses, even though no more clinics were coming to the nursing home. The staff at DPH told her that anyone who got their first dose should be able to find a second appointment at a mass vaccination site, community clinic or pharmacy.","\u003C!--more--\u003E","“You should be able to get an appointment, super easy. I’ll help you with it,” she relayed to her staff.","But the process has\u003Cdel\u003E\u003C\u002Fdel\u003E been anything but easy. In the weeks since those final employees were vaccinated, McPherson’s been scouring the web to find her staff second doses. Every time she looks, \u003Cdel\u003E\u003C\u002Fdel\u003Ethe appointments are all taken. That makes her feel like the state's vaccine rollout left them behind, and now there are too many eligible people and too few vaccines.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","“I can’t find them an appointment, and they can’t find an appointment. It feels like a gut punch to me that I can’t deliver for my staff,” McPherson says. “It just didn’t feel like we were done with health care [workers] yet, and all of a sudden it moved to other groups. Which was wonderful but, at the same time, there’s not enough allocated doses for all those people. It’s incredibly frustrating.”","That problem might get worse in the coming weeks. The state announced Wednesday that vaccine eligibility will open for \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fcommonhealth\u002F2021\u002F03\u002F17\u002Fbaker-massachusetts-full-vaccine-timeline-rollout\"\u003Emore people\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, starting with residents age 60 and older, and some types of workers, on March 22.","It's unclear exactly how many Massachusetts residents are currently hunting for second doses, but McPherson’s staff aren’t the only ones stuck in this vaccine limbo. The customer help line at CIC Health has received dozens of calls from people who didn’t schedule a second appointment right after they got their first shot at a CIC Health-run mass vaccination center, a \u003Cdel\u003E\u003C\u002Fdel\u003Ecompany spokesperson told WBUR.","Guests who are vaccinated at CIC Health-run sites are supposed to receive a QR code, a type of bar code readable by a smartphone or computer, that allows them to book their second shot. But in some cases, people didn’t receive that QR code, or they simply forgot to book an appointment using the code, which expires after a couple of days.","At that point, the patients face a dilemma. The state's vaccine web portal doesn't allow them to sign up for just a second dose. All they can do is call the state’s 2-1-1 line or CIC Health, but often there are simply no appointments available.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"2\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","CIC Health says the state has added a new system at mass vaccination centers that will send a special link via text or email after people receive their first dose. That link can be used to sign up for a second appointment.","At CIC Health's sites, staff members also check in with guests before they leave to make sure they get a second appointment and help them through the sign up process if they need it. Most people don’t leave without getting that second spot. But for those who do find themselves hunting for a second appointment, frustration abounds.","Part of the problem is that members of high priority groups like health care workers and people 75 and older now have to compete with a growing list of people, including educators, those with two or more health conditions that put them at a higher risk from COVID, and others, all for the same limited number of doses. At the moment, there just aren’t enough for everyone who is eligible and wants to be vaccinated, says Dr. Paul Biddinger, chief of emergency preparedness at Massachusetts General Hospital.","“It’s a challenge we have to address and one that will be made easier to deal with when we have more supply,” Biddinger says. “Hospitals, clinics and other vaccinators are being asked to basically use 100% of supply within 10 days, so you don’t have extra on shelves. It makes it extra hard to give an additional second dose when it’s not anticipated.”","A Department of Public Health spokesperson said the state will ensure that everyone who received a first dose will also get a second dose, although the DPH doesn't have information on how many people are in-between shots. The state also provides some \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.mass.gov\u002Finfo-details\u002Fcovid-19-vaccination-locations#scheduling-a-second-dose-appointment-\"\u003Eguidance\u003C\u002Fa\u003E on its website for people seeking second dose appointments.","The schedule for receiving a second dose does have some wiggle room, Biddinger adds. Guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there’s no harm in getting it a couple of weeks late.","“We reassure people that the CDC has said very clearly you have up to six weeks [to get the next shot] without any concern,” he says.","The CDC guidance also says it’s better to delay a second dose up to 6 weeks from the first injection than to \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cdc.gov\u002Fvaccines\u002Fcovid-19\u002Finfo-by-product\u002Fclinical-considerations.html\"\u003Emix shots of the Johnson &amp; Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer vaccines\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. However, in cases where someone cannot receive the same vaccine they did for the first shot, federal guidance says one of the other coronavirus vaccines can be used to complete the vaccination process.","That’s not particularly reassuring to McPherson, though. State guidance says you must get the same type of vaccine for both doses. And she says she might feel nervous mixing and matching vaccines, and she doesn’t want that for her co-workers either.","“Then they’d have to be the ones who are going to have to feel like the guinea pigs when they mix doses from two different vaccines,” she says.","McPherson says her employees &mdash; and health care workers on the front lines in general &mdash; should get the best protection that science and society have to offer. After all, she says, every day they've gone to work in the last year, they've taken risks.","“They showed up to work every day in the height of the pandemic. Not only showing up, but basically not leaving because they knew we needed help,” she says. “They deserve to be able to have that sense of security at work.”","\u003Chr \u002F\u003E","\u003Cem\u003EEditor's note: This story has been updated to reflect a new system put in place to help people sign up for second doses.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E"],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"segment","broadcastDate":"2021-03-18 06:45:00","broadcastTime":"06:45:00","itunesEpType":"","itunesEpNum":0,"itunesTitle":"","itunesSummary":"","itunesExplicit":false,"volume":3,"disqus":null,"enableComments":false,"googlePick":false,"suppressAudio":false,"amp":true,"audioDatetime":"1616071726","pullquotes":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":61,"type":"category","name":"Boston","description":"","slug":"boston","series":false,"count":49655},{"id":69,"type":"category","name":"Health","description":"","slug":"health","series":false,"count":16510},{"id":200,"type":"tag","name":"WBUR's Morning Edition","description":"Local content from WBUR's Morning Edition broadcasts","slug":"morning-edition","series":false,"count":5085},{"id":5222,"type":"tag","name":"Novel Coronavirus","description":"WBUR's ongoing coverage of the new coronavirus.","slug":"novel-coronavirus","series":false,"count":2997},{"id":5244,"type":"tag","name":"Coronavirus Liveblog","description":"WBUR news stories that appear in our continually updated liveblog on the coronavirus outbreak in Massachusetts.","slug":"coronavirus-liveblog","series":false,"count":982},{"id":5286,"type":"tag","name":"Spanish Translations","description":"WBUR has a partnership with El Planeta to translate certain stories into Spanish.

Charlie Baker about these plans. Highlights from this interview have been lightly edited for clarity.","\u003Ch2\u003EInterview Highlights\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EOn Baker's stated goal of achieving 70% vaccination in Mass. by the Fourth of July \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Well, the first thing I'd say is that we'll certainly have the capacity, you know, the people to deliver shots here in Massachusetts to make this happen. The big question mark &mdash; which has been the big question mark all along --  is how much supply will be available.","And  the good news there, which is why I'm optimistic about the timeline, is the Biden administration's task force told the governors earlier this week that they expect to not only up the shipments of Moderna and Pfizer, which I think as most people know is a two-dose vaccine, but to be able to dramatically scale the one-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine as well. And obviously the difference between one dose and being done, and two doses and being done, is pretty clear. And if they really do jack up the J&amp;J distribution in a big way, that will change the game not just for us in Massachusetts, but for everybody around the country.","\u003Cstrong\u003EOn worries over a potential fourth coronavirus wave expressed by public health officials like Anthony Fauci \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","I think the vaccine process here is very much a race against time. I said that several weeks ago, which is why I was so frustrated about the message we were getting about supply. I do believe that we have the ability to dramatically speed up, double the number of shots we deliver every day in Massachusetts if the supply is there. And we pay a ton of attention to the data we get around positive test rates and around hospitalizations and deaths and ICU beds.","That stuff is critically important to us as we make decisions. And I would just say that some of the changes that we've made are, I would argue, consistent with the public health data. I mean, our hospitalization rate has dropped dramatically over the course of the past two months.","And our positive test rate, while it has leveled out, has leveled out at 2%, which is &mdash; below 2% -- which is significantly down. It was 8.5% in January. And I think in many ways, this whole thing has always been a balancing act. We constantly go back to the data that's available through the very large data collection infrastructure that we've built here in Massachusetts. And we constantly make adjustments based on that information.","But I do think the fact that we're vaccinating an extraordinary number of people, we're the number one state in the country on a per capita basis among all the large states, and we're putting all the vaccines we get from the feds into people's arms virtually immediately. So I feel that if their supply numbers pan out the way the administration has talked about it, we should have a heck of a lot more people vaccinated in a pretty short period of time.","\u003Cstrong\u003E On early criticism over the state's vaccination rollout and whether things could have been done differently \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Well, hindsight's a great thing, Bob, as we all know, but I think the biggest challenge that we and other states have faced is this whole issue around available supply and the actual order in which people are getting vaccinated in Massachusetts. We had a vaccine advisory committee that helped us develop the phased rollout. The phased rollout for the most part that we put out in December is pretty much the phased rollout we're on right now. We expected that sometime around Patriots Day we would be opening it up to everybody in Massachusetts and that we were going to start with some populations that were significantly important to both preserving life and protecting our health care system. And that's what we did.","The whole sort of essential worker community and teacher community &mdash; educator, community, child-care workers, teachers and K-12 staff &mdash; they're currently eligible and they were prioritized by us. That ... process, for the most part, has played out pretty much along the lines of the rollout plan that we announced back in December.","I do get the fact that everybody's anxious about this and people want to get vaccinated. That's why we have something like, oh boy, the last time I looked, I think we have 900,000-plus people signed up on our preregistration system, and we already have a million people who are fully vaccinated and 1.7 million who have had at least one shot.","That just speaks to how anxious people are to get their vaccine. And I get the fact that that anxiety plays a part in the way people feel about everything. And I'm completely sympathetic to that. And people who want to get vaccinated are going to get vaccinated. They are. It's just a question of how fast we can get this supply.","\u003Cstrong\u003EOn reopening Massachusetts schools amid concerns for public safety\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Well this has been an ongoing discussion for over a year. And I would say three things, Bob. The first is, the data from all over the globe &mdash; including here in Massachusetts &mdash; is overwhelmingly clear that schools with mitigation in place &mdash; and the mitigation for the most part is reasonably consistent from place to place to place &mdash; are safe places. And in Massachusetts, you have literally tens of thousands of public school kids and staff and teachers, private school kids and staff and teachers, and parochial school kids and staff and teachers, who've been in school, in-person five days a week since August. And they've done it safely and successfully.","But that's not just true here in Massachusetts. That's literally true all over the country and all over the world. And there have been numerous studies that have been done that say the same thing, which is that kids in school with the proper precautions in place is a safe place for kids and a safe place for grownups, and for adults. And I think the study that we did, which involved, you know, hundreds of thousands of staff and students around the three feet vs. six feet issue with regard to distance, was a pretty clear indicator that three feet works. And there's no difference between three feet and six feet and I'm glad that the CDC, based on the results of our study, is taking another look at this question.","And the final thing I would say, Bob: We're also the only state in the country that's made available to our school districts a weekly surveillance testing program for those that are interested in pursuing it, and we're paying for it. We have 177 school districts &mdash; that's half the districts in Massachusetts &mdash; that have signed up to participate in it. So I think we've got a lot of the protocols, tons of experiential data at this point, as well as some pretty solid surveillance tools that are available to schools. And, boy, the data coming from the pediatric community and from others in the sort of child welfare space about the impact of no in-person learning on kids is really disturbing.","\u003Cstrong\u003EOn rebuilding the travel and tourism economy \u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","There's probably no industry that's been hit harder than the one that relies on a business traveler or a tourist for their success. And that's part of the reason why we created one of the largest, if not the largest, sort of small-business support grant programs in the country.","But I think, what I guess I would say, Bob, is what that industry needs most of all is for countries to successfully implement a vaccine strategy and to get to the point where, you know, herd immunity, which you talked about at the beginning of this conversation, is basically in place &mdash; not just nationally here in the U.S., but globally.","The good news there is, as more and more vaccines become available, more and more people are getting vaccinated. But I think it's going to be ... a long ride on this one. And we'll do what we can with our resources and with federal resources to support the folks and the businesses in those industries as we work our way through this. But ... anybody who's been in Logan Airport any time in the past year knows how big a hit the global travel market has taken as a result of COVID.","\u003Cstrong\u003EOn the possibility of Baker running for a third term as governor\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","So, Bob, I'm just curious to know if when you got to around the 15-year mark, anybody said to you, \"Gee, Bob, you've been doing this every single morning, five days a week, for 15 years. Do you really want to keep doing it?\" And I got a feeling your answer to that was, \"Yes.\" And as a result, we have been blessed to have you for way more than 15 years on our radio every morning, in our homes and in our cars.","I'm pulling your leg a little bit here, but I think the answer to the question is, both the lieutenant governor and I have been incredibly blessed to have the opportunity to do these jobs on behalf of the people of Massachusetts. I've lived here most of my life. I spent a big part of my career in state and local government. I really believe in the power and the importance of state and local government. And we have a ton of work to do even once we get past this pandemic to try to, you know, help people find a way back. We're doing a big report on the future of work, you know: What is work going to look like? Where are people going to work? Where are they going to live? How are they going to work, given everything that's changed as a result of the pandemic? There's plenty to do here."],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"segment","broadcastDate":"2021-03-19 07:45:00","broadcastTime":"07:45:00","itunesEpType":"","itunesEpNum":0,"itunesTitle":"","itunesSummary":"","itunesExplicit":false,"volume":3,"disqus":null,"enableComments":false,"googlePick":false,"suppressAudio":false,"amp":true,"audioDatetime":"1616157774","pullquotes":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":61,"type":"category","name":"Boston","description":"","slug":"boston","series":false,"count":49655},{"id":63,"type":"category","name":"Business","description":"","slug":"business","series":false,"count":7797},{"id":65,"type":"category","name":"Economy","description":"","slug":"economy","series":false,"count":6538},{"id":66,"type":"category","name":"Education","description":"","slug":"education","series":false,"count":5213},{"id":69,"type":"category","name":"Health","description":"","slug":"health","series":false,"count":16510},{"id":70,"type":"category","name":"Life","description":"","slug":"life","series":false,"count":7720},{"id":73,"type":"category","name":"News","description":"","slug":"news","series":false,"count":58847},{"id":75,"type":"category","name":"Politics","description":"","slug":"politics","series":false,"count":25527},{"id":200,"type":"tag","name":"WBUR's Morning Edition","description":"Local content from WBUR's Morning Edition broadcasts","slug":"morning-edition","series":false,"count":5085},{"id":5465,"type":"tag","name":"Coronavirus Vaccine Coverage","description":"WBUR's ongoing coverage of the testing, approval processes, safety and distribution of vaccines to fight against the coronavirus pandemic.","slug":"coronavirus-vaccines","series":false,"count":284}],"audio":[{"id":98089,"createdAt":"2021-03-19 08:42:54","updatedAt":"2021-03-19 11:19:13","fileName":"news_0319_charlie-baker-massachusetts-phase-four-vaccines","playCount":0,"airDate":"2021-03-19","source":"news","wordpressTitle":"As Vaccines Ramp Up, Gov.

Since the last FERC meeting more than 60 organizations, companies, interest groups and individuals \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Felibrary.ferc.gov\u002FeLibrary\u002Fsearch\"\u003Ehave filed motions\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to become “intervenors” &mdash; essentially, legal participants in the proceeding. (The Sustainable FERC Project is one of them.)","The outcome of the briefing period remains unclear; FERC could vote to hold a hearing, or it could decide to take no action and let the compressor continue operating. But what is clear is that this uncertainty makes the situation more fraught.","Those in the gas industry, as well as those concerned about fossil fuel infrastructure, are left wondering about not only the future of the Weymouth Compressor, but also the fate of all other gas and pipeline projects.","“It seemed like the process was done.

And so for FERC to potentially revisit it “is a big issue for really anybody interested in building energy infrastructure around the United States.”","Giannetti, of the Sustainable FERC Projects, agrees. Imagine you were a gas company with “a project that is built, in service and has a FERC certificate that's 4 years old, and then something happens at one of your compressor stations &mdash; some safety issue,” she says. “There's a concern that this is an attempt to reopen and relitigate FERC authorizations that happened in a different FERC, in a different era.”","\u003Cspan data-index=\"4\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Dissenting Commissioners\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Two FERC commissioners &mdash; James Danly and Mark Christie &mdash; voted against the paper briefing process.

Ryan Fattman of Webster; his wife Stephanie Fattman, the Worcester County Register of Probate; and a number of related individuals and campaign committees against Michael Sullivan, the head of the Massachusetts Office of Campaign and Political Finance.","Judge Christine Roach's decision Friday suggests the Fattmans are challenging “certain aspects” of the way Sullivan is handling an investigation involving them, including allegedly making legal errors, abusing his discretion, and acting arbitrarily and capriciously. But it’s not clear from the document what exactly OCFP is investigating. The Fattmans have argued that all the proceedings should permanently be closed to the public.","WBUR petitioned the court to gain access to Friday's hearing. WBUR's attorney Jeffrey Pyle argued there is a strong public interest in opening the proceedings, since civil court proceedings are normally public and this particular case involves two public officials and a state agency.","\"These elected officials are subject to public scrutiny &mdash; as is the defendant, OCPF,\" wrote Pyle, a partner with Boston law firm Prince Lobel.","But Roach denied WBUR’s request to attend Friday’s hearing and has refused to release key documents in the case.","Roach issued an oral order Wednesday “preliminarily\" impounding the documents. But the court rules she cited say an impoundment order can be entered only after a hearing and a public, written finding that there is good cause to restrict access to the documents. Neither of those steps happened before her initial order.","After the closed court hearing Friday, Roach issued a written ruling saying she found there was good cause to temporarily impound the lawsuit and certain other  documents, because OCPF's investigation is confidential.","Roach, however, said she planned to hold another hearing on March 26 to decide whether to permanently impound the papers, saying she also wanted to consider other factors, such as the First Amendment right to access the courts and the community interest in the case. The decision says WBUR will be permitted to attend the second hearing.","Peter Caruso Sr., an Andover attorney who has frequently helped media fight for access to court proceedings over the years, said blocking public access to documents or hearings in civil cases is justified only in rare, exceptional circumstances — something he doubted existed here.","\"To close a courtroom in Massachusetts is generally unheard of,\" Caruso said. \"That's because we are not in Russia, not in Cuba and certainly not part of a star chamber. All court proceedings must be open to the public.\"","Both OCPF and the attorney representing the Fattmans and other plaintiffs declined comment. Sullivan's attorney did not respond to requests for comment.

She was getting questions from her patients who wanted to get the vaccine, but were left in the dark because of the lack of data on pregnant people.","“We take care of these women all the time, and they have questions about, ‘Well, if this wasn’t studied in people like me, do we know that it works? Is it safe?' So, the [study] was motivated by pragmatic, real life concerns that our patients have,” Edlow says. “Once the vaccines became available and pregnant and lactating women were making the choice to get them, we said, ‘Well of course, we need to study this.’”","\u003C!--more--\u003E","The study, which was published this month on \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.medrxiv.org\u002Fcontent\u002F10.1101\u002F2021.03.07.21253094v1.full.pdf\"\u003EmedrXiv.com\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, followed 131 women. Eighty-four of the participants were pregnant, 31 were lactating, and the rest were non-pregnant and non-lactating women between the ages of 18 and 45.","First, Edlow and her colleagues measured the level of antibodies in the participants before and after they received the vaccine and monitored them for any side effects. The goal was to answer the most basic question of whether the vaccines work in pregnant people.","Overall, Edlow says, the response of pregnant and lactating people to the vaccine was pretty much identical to the response of non-pregnant participants in the trial. They all experienced same levels of side effects and created similar amounts of antibodies that can neutralize and destroy the coronavirus.","“That was one really great point – it works. The vaccine works really well in pregnant women,” Edlow says.","Not only did Edlow discover high levels of protective antibodies in the women, but when 10 of the participants gave birth, the researchers were able to detect the same antibodies in all 10 of the babies’ umbilical cord blood. In particular, Edlow detected high levels of a flavor of antibody called an IgG antibody, which is associated with blood and tends to be more durable and long-lasting than other antibodies.","“There was one participant who only received one dose of a COVID vaccine [at the time of giving birth], and those antibody levels were lower in the umbilical cord blood,” Edlow says. “It seems like completing the two shots for many reasons, especially for the person’s health and safety but also to give higher doses of antibodies to the neonate, makes sense.”","People who have already given birth but were lactating when they received the vaccine are also likely transferring antibodies to their children through breast milk, Edlow adds. How exactly dousing the child’s mouth and intestinal tract with antibody-laden breast milk protects them is an area of ongoing research.","“One thing is they interact with the microbiome, the gut bacteria that are present, and can shape the baby’s immunity that way,” she says. “But we know that breastfeeding does give protection to babies and is probably complementary to the immune protection that babies receive through the umbilical cord.”","In particular, the scientists found that the breast milk contained the same IgG antibodies found in the umbilical cord blood and another type of antibody called IgA, typically associated with mucus membranes like the linings of the lungs, throat, mouth and nose. So, Edlow says, it’s also possible the antibodies stand guard on the surface of the baby’s membranes and prevent the virus from attacking that way.","“I have a friend who is currently breastfeeding. We talked about it, and I remember telling her she should get vaccinated and my hope was that she would be able to transfer antibodies to her baby,” says Dr. Sabrina Assoumou, an immunologist at Boston Medical Center who did not work on the study. “So, I bookmarked this study so that I could say, ‘See! Get vaccinated! You’re helping your little daughter.’”","While the study is a preprint and has not been formally peer-reviewed, Assoumou says she’s confident in the results for several reasons. First, there’s a pile of work showing that other vaccines allow antibodies to transfer through the placenta and breast milk.","“Biologically, it makes sense. We’ve seen it in other diseases. That’s why we vaccinate the mom [during pregnancy], to protect the baby from like pertussis, [diphtheria, tetanus] and influenza,” she says. “I’m always nervous about commenting on pre-prints, but this one, the science made sense, and I knew it was from a good group.”","It’s not clear how long these antibodies last in the newborn, however. So, mothers who have been vaccinated for COVID-19 should still plan to get their children vaccinated after they’re born, Edlow says.","And until the study is formally peer-reviewed, Edlow says the results probably shouldn’t be used to inform clinical decisions just yet. But that’s also why it’s important for pregnant and lactating people to be included in clinical trials in the first place, she adds.","“They are often some of the most vulnerable individuals, especially to respiratory pathogens [like the coronavirus],” she says. “[We should] protect pregnant women and lactating women through research, not protect them from research. Why not study this group, and why not let those individuals make the choice whether or not they think it’s too risky to participate?”"],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"","broadcastDate":"","broadcastTime":"","itunesEpType":"","itunesEpNum":0,"itunesTitle":"","itunesSummary":"","itunesExplicit":false,"volume":3,"disqus":null,"enableComments":false,"googlePick":false,"suppressAudio":false,"amp":true,"audioDatetime":null,"pullquotes":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":61,"type":"category","name":"Boston","description":"","slug":"boston","series":false,"count":49655},{"id":69,"type":"category","name":"Health","description":"","slug":"health","series":false,"count":16510},{"id":73,"type":"category","name":"News","description":"","slug":"news","series":false,"count":58847},{"id":5222,"type":"tag","name":"Novel Coronavirus","description":"WBUR's ongoing coverage of the new coronavirus.","slug":"novel-coronavirus","series":false,"count":2997},{"id":5465,"type":"tag","name":"Coronavirus Vaccine Coverage","description":"WBUR's ongoing coverage of the testing, approval processes, safety and distribution of vaccines to fight against the coronavirus pandemic.","slug":"coronavirus-vaccines","series":false,"count":284}],"audio":[],"embedMeta":null,"images":[{"type":"featured","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2021\u002F02\u002Fvaccine.jpg","width":3000,"height":2000,"title":"A syringe filled with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.

Too many ranches and capes, with their dormered windows peeking onto the street, have ended up in dumpsters. The process is routine: A large excavator rolls off a flatbed first thing in the morning, and sometimes by lunch, has clawed an ordinary home to pieces, ripping off walls and windows and roofs.","Once I watched the demolition of a home nearby and witnessed the claw carefully tear away the entire facade first, leaving the inside open and vulnerable. It was astonishing to see the fireplace, bathroom fixtures and full kitchen, with cupboards, refrigerator and stove intact, awaiting the homeowners’ return that evening. Hours later, those home components were also in the dumpster, as if no one had ever cooked at that stove while children did homework at the table nearby.","When a lot was cleared, a house three times larger emerged in its place, often with five bedrooms and five bathrooms for a family with two children. Mansionization was a constant talking point in town, but the teardowns continued, unabated.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"pullquote\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","Just before we were grounded by the pandemic, my daughter Joanna and I traveled to Dahlem, the district in western Berlin where my mother was born. I was anxious to visit the sweet cottage where she had lived as a young girl, with its orchards of peach and plum trees, the gardens of dahlias and helenium and daisies &mdash; life before my mother and her family were forced from their homeland by the Nazis.","But the cottage, like my family, had a will to survive. Although my grandparents were forced to leave Germany with almost nothing, an English woman and her German husband, unsympathetic to Hitler, bought the Dahlem home, promising to deposit a fair sum of money in a bank in England. The woman, Christabel Bielenberg, wrote about this agreement in \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FWhen-Was-German-1934-1945-Englishwoman\u002Fdp\u002F0803261519\"\u003Eher book\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, \"When I Was a German, 1934-1945: An Englishwoman in Nazi Germany.\"","Indeed, when my grandparents arrived in England, they found the money in a designated bank account, and the Bielenbergs later left the deed to the property in their name. Although so much had been lost, the family home survived the war. But by then, my grandparents and their daughters were living in America. They never returned to their former home in Germany.","Other family members have visited Dahlem over the years. After the Bielenbergs moved on, another couple lived in the home for several decades, and warmly greeted my sister and later my nieces, once they heard the story of our family connection. And now I, too, was finally going to experience this part of my ancestral history.","My daughter and I arrived by train in Dahlem and knew it was only a short walk to #30 Falkenried, the address of my mother’s former home. I had studied family photographs so often, I felt that I’d been there countless times before. But now after all those years, I was on the street with impatient anticipation, looking for the house. We walked up and down Falkenried twice, yet couldn’t find it. Recent Google Street photos depicted my mother’s former home hidden behind overgrown trees, so Joanna and I stopped looking for the cottage and started looking for orchards reaching the sky.","We found neither. The gardens and welcoming cottage with its thatched peaks were gone. It was easy to see why we had missed our #30. Gun-metal-toned numerals blended with a locked metal gate, protecting a sterile modern house with a flat roof. Just as in my former town, here the new owners had built a house more to their liking.","Joanna and I were heartbroken. I’d waited so long to take this trip, to make this connection with my mother’s past and our ancestry. And then this cherished home, saved by the Bielenbergs and another couple who had loved it just as my grandparents had, was destroyed.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"2\" data-type=\"pullquote\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","I’ve thought so often about the meaning of home, which is much more than a physical structure of brick or wood. Home is a container of memories, a safe haven, a place where you feel secure. But my grandparents, like many victims of war and violence, lost that security when they were forced from their home.","A few years ago, my former husband and I sold the family home where we had raised our children. The new owners explicitly stated their desire to tear it down and build something larger and grander. It’s true that the house needed new kitchen cabinets. The bathrooms were outdated, as was the floor plan. But it was the home in which my children lost their first teeth, learned to ride shiny two-wheelers, the home where we had celebrated birthdays and graduations. My daughter’s bedroom door still had pencil markings commemorating her yearly growth. I can hear my grown son’s high school rock band practicing in the basement.","The last time I visited my former town, the house was still standing. I also know that one of these days, I may arrive and find it gone. But it is no longer my home, and the owners are entitled to build one more to their liking. However, even if the house is demolished, my memories won’t end up in the dumpster. I’m comforted knowing that my grandparents took memories of #30 Falkenried with them to America, just as I will take mine wherever I go.","\u003Cem\u003EFollow Cognoscenti on \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.facebook.com\u002Fcogwbur\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003EFacebook\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fcogwbur\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003ETwitter\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E"],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"","broadcastDate":"","broadcastTime":"","itunesEpType":"","itunesEpNum":0,"itunesTitle":"","itunesSummary":"","itunesExplicit":false,"volume":3,"disqus":null,"enableComments":false,"googlePick":false,"suppressAudio":false,"amp":true,"audioDatetime":null,"pullquotes":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":62,"type":"category","name":"Books","description":"","slug":"books","series":false,"count":4649},{"id":64,"type":"category","name":"Crime & Justice","description":"","slug":"crime-justice","series":false,"count":9770},{"id":70,"type":"category","name":"Life","description":"","slug":"life","series":false,"count":7720},{"id":73,"type":"category","name":"News","description":"","slug":"news","series":false,"count":58847},{"id":74,"type":"category","name":"Opinion","description":"","slug":"opinion","series":false,"count":5579},{"id":75,"type":"category","name":"Politics","description":"","slug":"politics","series":false,"count":25527},{"id":830,"type":"tag","name":"Holocaust","description":"","slug":"holocaust","series":false,"count":20}],"audio":[],"embedMeta":{"embed-1":{"id":1,"parentID":665383,"type":"pullquote","attributes":null,"body":"But the cottage, like my family, had a will to survive.","placeholder":"\u003Cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"pullquote\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E"},"embed-2":{"id":2,"parentID":665383,"type":"pullquote","attributes":null,"body":"I had studied family photographs so often, I felt that I’d been there countless times before.

It's really up to the creator. And then OnlyFans has fans that subscribe to various creators. ... And in the past year, since the pandemic, this platform has grown in a huge way. And it's become one of the main ways in which a lot of students are doing sex work these days.","I think from the students that we talked to, it's a way to express themselves creatively. ... One of our sources who goes by the name WeekndWrrior, she isn't really able to, because of health issues, work a 9 to 5 job every day. And so being able to, you know, have this job where she can make her own hours &mdash; [and it's] very flexible &mdash; is really convenient for her. And some people just really like it. And especially within the pandemic, it's not always the safest to have, like, industry jobs in the food industry and stuff. So right now, it just really makes the most sense for a lot of these students.","\u003Cstrong\u003EOn some students turning the posting of nude photos into a profitable business:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Dana Gerber: [One source] said that since high school she's made $120,000. So it has proved really lucrative. I do want to say that only the top percentage of creators really make a sustainable income. [We] mentioned WeekndWrrior, who uses the money to help put herself through college. She said she didn't have a lot of financial support from her family. ... So these kids aren't becoming millionaires, but it seems that there are definitely tactics to use to increase their income. It's not just sending out photos randomly. They make schedules. They determine the times that people are most willing to purchase photos.","\u003Cstrong\u003EOn some students escalating the interaction with their clients:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Dana Gerber: One of the sources in the story spoke about [an experience in which] she once video-chatted with a client, but that wasn't really something she was comfortable with. ... So she had mostly stuck to selling pictures and videos of herself but didn't do that face-to-face with clients. One of the women we spoke with would have a pretty one-on-one connection with her clients ... through SnapChat. So it was private messages. She told us about a time she went to a local restaurant near Emerson, and she got eight pitchers of margaritas with her friends. And then she texted one of her clients asking him to pay for it, and he did. So it does seem that some of them established more personal connections with their clients and that that, of course, I'm sure helped them make more money.","\u003Cstrong\u003EOn physical safety risks:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Dana Gerber: The people we spoke with were very cognizant that this has inherent risks and dangers. They've all gone to extreme lengths to make sure that their identities as sex workers were completely disentangled from their [real\u002Factual] online identities.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EOn students who are survivors of sexual trauma being involved in the sex industry:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Ann Matica: [One of the students we interviewed] is a survivor of sexual trauma. And at the point before she started doing sex work, it was something that was really consuming her. Her mental health was at an all-time low, and she felt like her body was no longer her own. And then when she began doing sex work and taking nude photos of herself, and kind of getting that autonomy back over her own body and her own self image, she found it really empowering. And while that is not always the case for everybody, [she says] it has been a very positive experience on her journey to heal from that very extreme trauma that she experienced.","Dana Gerber: One of our sources described being groomed as a child and being hypersexualized by this family member who was grooming her. And of course, while that was not a positive experience, she described going into sex work as a positive experience because she had sort of embraced that hypersexuality by that point in her life. ... She did describe having a mental breakdown while she was doing sex work, [but] it wasn't directly tied to that. I believe, from what I got from speaking with her, it was sort of compounded with a lot of other duties and responsibilities. ... And she also described body image issues and stuff, which sort of, again, ties into the sex work. But, by and large, she described sex work as a really positive and empowering and fulfilling experience.","____","WBUR reached out to Britain-based OnlyFans multiple times requesting comment but did not receive a response to our questions.","According to the company's website, it has more than one million content creators and more than 100 million users\u002Fsubscribers, up from 10 million users in July of 2019.","For more on the risks involved in the commercial sex industry, Jack Lepiarz also spoke with Lisa Goldblatt Grace. She's a clinical social worker and executive director of Boston-based \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.mylifemychoice.org\u002F\"\u003EMy Life My Choice\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, which works to protect youth from exploitation in the illegal sex trade. Goldblatt Grace says the organization also continues working with young people as they transition to adulthood, some of whom end up involved in the sex industry.","We asked her about her knowledge of the site OnlyFans.","Lisa Goldblatt Grace: When I think about a site like OnlyFans, what I hear from young people that we care for is that it's a place that exploiters will push for them to post pictures. It's often beginning with something that's exclusively virtual, but moving into things that are face-to-face. And as you can imagine, in person is much, much more dangerous. So in terms of their physical safety, there's a whole continuum there &mdash; and I would argue in terms of their emotional safety. And any time that we say it's OK to buy sexual access to another human being, any time we commodify a human being, we've caused harm.","\u003Cstrong\u003EOn any concerns surrounding people with a history of trauma or mental illness being involved in the commercial sex industry:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","What we know about the commercial sex industry in general is that somewhere between 70% and 90% of women in the commercial sex industry have a history of sexual abuse. I mean, in reading this [Berkeley Beacon] article, it sounded like the young people felt like they had a choice, and they had options, and this is the one that they chose. ... I have nothing to say about their particular lives. But that is not the case for the vast majority of young people and young adults that we see every day. Frankly, it's about the absence of choice. If you've been taught that you're valuable only for sex, if you're in a coercive or violent relationship, if you're needing money to pay bills or to otherwise navigate the world in the context of all of this, that's about not having choice, right? That's not about having some good options in front of you and choosing the one that feels the best or the most empowering or makes the most sense.","\u003Cstrong\u003EOn whether there are positive aspects in terms of having autonomy over your own body:\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","I understand that. And I've heard that argument often. And we each have the right to have full control over what we do with our body. So this is not me sitting here in judgment. It is me sitting here saying that there is harm in this industry, whether it's felt now, 10 years from now, 20 years from now. And it's very rare to be able to navigate this ... egregiously abusive and misogynistic industry without having it exacerbate your trauma or give you trauma if you've never experienced it. ... This isn't about sex. This is about somebody having the power to buy somebody else."],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"","broadcastDate":"","broadcastTime":"","itunesEpType":"","itunesEpNum":0,"itunesTitle":"","itunesSummary":"","itunesExplicit":false,"volume":3,"disqus":null,"enableComments":false,"googlePick":false,"suppressAudio":false,"amp":true,"audioDatetime":null,"pullquotes":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":61,"type":"category","name":"Boston","description":"","slug":"boston","series":false,"count":49655},{"id":70,"type":"category","name":"Life","description":"","slug":"life","series":false,"count":7720},{"id":78,"type":"category","name":"Technology","description":"","slug":"technology","series":false,"count":2742}],"audio":[],"embedMeta":{"embed-1":{"id":1,"parentID":669177,"type":"caption","attributes":{"id":"attachment_669204","align":"alignright","width":"400","caption":"OnlyFans allows people to create content, including photos and videos, to which \"fans\" subscribe.

Then they invited several different animal species to figure out which cup hid the treat.","Chimps, despite their cleverness, just kept choosing one of the cups at random. But bonobos (and dogs) almost immediately learned to look to the scientist for a gesture indicating the right cup.","One study even \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Flink.springer.com\u002Farticle\u002F10.1007\u002Fs00429-018-1751-9\"\u003Efound\u003C\u002Fa\u003E a structural difference between the brains of bonobos and chimps.

Since then, we humans have channeled our inner bonobo to share and cooperate on a massive scale.","But we've often acted more like chimps — whose murder rate in the wild is comparable to our own — when it comes to behaviors like violence against members of our own species.","Humans do not share bonobos' assumption that every stranger is a potential friend. Studies show we may not even consider a stranger fully human if they belong to a group perceived as other and threatening. ","When that happens, scientists say, we tend to suppress empathy and embrace cruelty.","Human cruelty is something Yvonne Vela Tona, a caretaker at Lola ya Bonobo, has seen up close. ","Vela Tona fled Angola more than 20 years ago to escape a civil war that would eventually kill more than 500,000 people. Since then, she's lived in the DRC, a nation where decades of armed conflict has led to millions of deaths.","Vela Tona has raised children of her own and served as a surrogate mother to more than 20 bonobos. She's seen both the chimp and bonobo sides of human behavior.","What people can learn from bonobos, she tells me through an interpreter, is that war and violence are not inevitable, that we, like bonobos, have the capacity to resolve conflicts through other means.

His father, accomplished guitarist and singer Terry Barber, deserves the credit, he says.","“By the time I was 4 years old, I had a guitar and he taught me some chords,” Strings says. “And my dad would play all the fancy licks and I just played rhythm.”","\u003Cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"youtube\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","In the back bedroom of a small trailer, then 6-year-old Strings vividly remembers his aha moment with the guitar. He and his dad, clad in just their underwear, were playing Doc Watson’s “Beaumont Rag,” an old fiddle tune.","After multiple hiccups playing the chords, a frustrated Strings says he told his dad to stop and let him listen to the melody. Instead of trying to follow along with Barber in the moment, Strings just listened to what his dad’s guitar was saying.","When the time came to try it once more, Strings — now equipped with the melody in his head — “frickin’ nailed it,” he says.","Barber “was so proud, he just leaned over and squeezed my little hand. And that moment has pushed me to this day,” Strings says. “I still think about that. Like the other day when we won the Grammy, who did I call? I called my dad right away. Look dad, you taught me well.”","It’s clear Billy Strings’ name suits him well. Strings, born William Apostol, says his name came about from his Aunt Mondi, a woman whose vivacious life had a great impact on the young man. She dubbed him “Little Billy Strings” when he was a kid.","Mondi was on her deathbed during his teenage years, he says. On an unplanned visit to her house, he recalls how she got out of bed right away.","“And it wasn't long before the guitars got busted out, because Mondi always wanted to hear us play,” he says. “Man, it was just this crazy thing.”","Drinks and joints were in abundance at this extemporaneous music session, he says. She had been sober for about four or five years because of her illness, he says, but nothing could stop her from indulging in the joy of a night surrounded by good company and non-stop jams.","She died shortly after that night, he says. He had just started dabbling with open mic nights, so after her death, “when I went up to the chalkboard to write my name up there, I wrote Billy Strings in her honor,” he says.","The name has stuck ever since.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"2\" data-type=\"youtube\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","Strings spent a lot of time listening to rock and heavy metal as a teenager. His taste for an array of genres can be found steeped into the end of “Home,” a song that eclipses traditional bluegrass.","He describes Johnny Winter’s seamless guitar playing as having a “big impact” on him as a young musician. Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Pink Floyd were also significant influences.","“The psychedelia of Pink Floyd was really interesting, you know, like as a young kid with a very imaginative mind, listening to the album ‘The Dark Side of the Moon’ was like watching a movie,” he explains.","Strings’ song collection isn’t all strange sounds, effects and genre-mixing, though. He inserts pure bluegrass, like the song “Hollow Heart,” throughout his work “almost like a palate cleanser,” he says.","A dark energy can be felt vibrating through “Home.” Notably, the 4-minute-long instrumental “Guitar Peace” exudes a somber feeling throughout. Strings says one day, he got high and played a stream of consciousness, thus “Guitar Peace” was born.","“I just smoked a bunch of weed and tried to put something out,” he says.","While smoking cannabis often inspires him to pick up the guitar, he’s in no way reliant on the drug during the creative process, he says. If anything, weed helps the mood or the emotion of a song he’s crafting, he says.","Another melancholy song on the album, “Enough To Leave,” came to fruition after two of his friends died of heroin overdoses within about a week of each other. One of them was a buddy that helped Strings advance in the music scene.","“Man, I was just crushed,” he says. “So I just sat down and wrote that song and kind of wanted to do something for 'em. And that's kind of all I know how to do.”","\u003Cspan data-index=\"3\" data-type=\"youtube\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","Strings is currently occupied by another thing he knows how to do well, something he’s mastered at this point: living on a tour bus. Strings and his touring band, which includes artists on the banjo, bass and mandolin, are headed to Florida for a socially-distant concert, where fans in small pods can get lost in the music.","After, he’ll head to New Orleans, where he’ll perform on stage before a crowd of none. The show will be live streamed for people at home.","“I can't wait to play for people again. That's what I do. I know it's a release for a lot of those folks as it is for me,” he says. “Just getting able to get together with my band and playing music is such a blessing.”","\u003Chr \u002F\u003E","\u003Cem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Finside\u002Fstaff\u002Femiko-tamagawa\"\u003EEmiko Tamagawa\u003C\u002Fa\u003E produced and edited this interview for broadcast with \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Finside\u002Fstaff\u002Ftinku-ray\"\u003ETinku Ray\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fserenaamcmahon\"\u003ESerena McMahon\u003C\u002Fa\u003E adapted it for the web.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E"],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"segment","broadcastDate":"2021-03-19 13:20:00","broadcastTime":"13:20:00","itunesEpType":"","itunesEpNum":0,"itunesTitle":"","itunesSummary":"","itunesExplicit":false,"volume":3,"disqus":null,"enableComments":false,"googlePick":false,"suppressAudio":false,"amp":true,"audioDatetime":"1616176182","pullquotes":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":72,"type":"category","name":"Music","description":"","slug":"music","series":false,"count":3031}],"audio":[{"id":98107,"createdAt":"2021-03-19 13:49:42","updatedAt":"2021-03-19 15:48:31","fileName":"hereandnow_0319_billy-strings-bluegrass-home","playCount":0,"airDate":"2021-03-19","source":"hereandnow","wordpressTitle":"Billy Strings' Journey From Learning Guitar In A Trailer With His Dad To Winning A Grammy","wordpressSlug":"billy-strings-bluegrass-home","status":"available","subType":"primary","audioLength":666,"nprCDNFilename":null,"description":"The 28 year old eclipses traditional bluegrass in his Grammy-winning album \"Home.\" ","megaphoneID":"7c31b7f8-88db-11eb-9bc5-db5febd92aae","megaphoneURL":"http:\u002F\u002Ftraffic.megaphone.fm\u002FBUR5681378755.mp3","articleAPIURL":"http:\u002F\u002Fapi.wbur.org\u002Fstories?id=669212&org=wbur","audioAPIURL":"http:\u002F\u002Fapi.wbur.org\u002Faudio\u002F98107","org":"wbur","orgKey":null,"audioMeta":[{"extension":"mp3","sizeInBytes":5326294,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fdts.podtrac.com\u002Fredirect.mp3\u002Ftraffic.megaphone.fm\u002FBUR5681378755.mp3"},{"extension":"mp4","sizeInBytes":5326294,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fdts.podtrac.com\u002Fredirect.mp3\u002Fs3.amazonaws.com\u002Faudio.wbur.org\u002F2021\u002F03\u002Fhereandnow_0319_billy-strings-bluegrass-home.mp4"}]}],"embedMeta":{"embed-1":{"id":1,"parentID":669212,"type":"youtube","attributes":{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=EMXf3g6G7dA"},"body":"","placeholder":"\u003Cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"youtube\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E"},"embed-2":{"id":2,"parentID":669212,"type":"youtube","attributes":{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=_qaaA_umhcc"},"body":"","placeholder":"\u003Cspan data-index=\"2\" data-type=\"youtube\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E"},"embed-3":{"id":3,"parentID":669212,"type":"youtube","attributes":{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=3zzunMVvudw"},"body":"","placeholder":"\u003Cspan data-index=\"3\" data-type=\"youtube\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E"}},"images":[{"type":"featured","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2021\u002F03\u002Fbilly.jpg","width":1000,"height":667,"title":"Billy Strings.

You don't get to vandalize,” he says. “You know, First Amendment activity is about protest, and criminal activity is about vandalism and violence. And we cannot tolerate that.”","By leaving Houston, Acevedo says he’s creating an opportunity for one of his executive assistants to continue to serve the community as police chief.","He has family in Miami and hopes that more relatives will move there as well. He’s also looking forward to helping strengthen the Miami Police Department. While in Houston, he worked to become an agent of change, though he admits he wasn’t always perfect.","“But if you gauge where we were at as an organization and where we were at when I left, I would argue that we've left places in a better place,” he says.","In recent years, police killings in Houston have gained attention. Six people were killed by police in six years, and Acevedo blocked the release of body cam footage of the incidents.","The reason for that, Acevedo says, is that police executives have a responsibility to follow the process in place and officers are held accountable for misconduct.","But Acevedo says a newly-appointed Houston district attorney approved of releasing videos. Now they’re awaiting the mayor’s permission.","During a recent \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.click2houston.com\u002Fnews\u002Flocal\u002F2021\u002F03\u002F17\u002Foutgoing-hpd-chiefs-message-to-houston-get-ready-for-500-murders\u002F\"\u003Enews conference\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, Acevedo mentioned that Houston can expect 500 more homicides in the next year. In spite of the grim number, Acevedo says he doesn’t take that as a sign he’s failed, but instead an admission that there’s a problem.","Acevedo adds that “activist judges and prosecutors” are prone to treating everyone “like they're shoplifters, including murderers.”","“Over 100 individuals were murdered last year in the city of Houston by suspects that were out on bond for, most of them, for violent crimes,” he says.","Acevedo also says there’s a circular criminal justice system where criminals are arrested, but go on to commit more crimes after their release. Acevedo says the police department is doing their job and everyone else needs to do theirs.","“You cannot keep people and keep turning them loose that are committing violence and letting the same people time and again be part of the problem,” he says.","\u003Chr \u002F\u003E","\u003Cem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Finside\u002Fstaff\u002Fmark-navin\"\u003EMark Navin\u003C\u002Fa\u003E produced and edited this interview for broadcast with \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Finside\u002Fstaff\u002Ftodd-mundt\"\u003ETodd Mundt\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Findeliblejae\"\u003EJeannette Jones\u003C\u002Fa\u003E adapted it for the web.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E"],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"segment","broadcastDate":"2021-03-19 13:40:00","broadcastTime":"13:40:00","itunesEpType":"","itunesEpNum":0,"itunesTitle":"","itunesSummary":"","itunesExplicit":false,"volume":3,"disqus":null,"enableComments":false,"googlePick":false,"suppressAudio":false,"amp":true,"audioDatetime":"1616176859","pullquotes":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":73,"type":"category","name":"News","description":"","slug":"news","series":false,"count":58847}],"audio":[{"id":98110,"createdAt":"2021-03-19 14:00:59","updatedAt":"2021-03-19 14:01:00","fileName":"hereandnow_0319_art-acevedo-houston-miami","playCount":0,"airDate":"2021-03-19","source":"hereandnow","wordpressTitle":"Houston Police Chief Leaves To Take Up Top Job In Miami","wordpressSlug":"art-acevedo-houston-miami","status":"available","subType":"primary","audioLength":383,"nprCDNFilename":null,"description":"Houston police chief Art Acevedo became a national figure when he marched with protestors who were protesting the police killing of George Floyd.","megaphoneID":"0ffe251a-88dd-11eb-8ca4-c3534cea0772","megaphoneURL":"http:\u002F\u002Ftraffic.megaphone.fm\u002FBUR7203085522.mp3","articleAPIURL":"http:\u002F\u002Fapi.wbur.org\u002Fstories?id=669188&org=wbur","audioAPIURL":"http:\u002F\u002Fapi.wbur.org\u002Faudio\u002F98110","org":"wbur","orgKey":null,"audioMeta":[{"extension":"mp3","sizeInBytes":3067852,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fdts.podtrac.com\u002Fredirect.mp3\u002Ftraffic.megaphone.fm\u002FBUR7203085522.mp3"},{"extension":"mp4","sizeInBytes":3067852,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fdts.podtrac.com\u002Fredirect.mp3\u002Fs3.amazonaws.com\u002Faudio.wbur.org\u002F2021\u002F03\u002Fhereandnow_0319_art-acevedo-houston-miami.mp4"}]}],"embedMeta":null,"images":[{"type":"featured","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2021\u002F03\u002FGettyImages-842618668.jpg","width":1024,"height":744,"title":"Houston police chief Art Acevedo looks on during a press conference following a tour of the NRG Center evacuation center on Sept. 4, 2017, in Houston, Texas.

His father, accomplished guitarist and singer Terry Barber, deserves the credit, he says.","“By the time I was 4 years old, I had a guitar and he taught me some chords,” Strings says. “And my dad would play all the fancy licks and I just played rhythm.”","\u003Cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"youtube\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","In the back bedroom of a small trailer, then 6-year-old Strings vividly remembers his aha moment with the guitar. He and his dad, clad in just their underwear, were playing Doc Watson’s “Beaumont Rag,” an old fiddle tune.","After multiple hiccups playing the chords, a frustrated Strings says he told his dad to stop and let him listen to the melody. Instead of trying to follow along with Barber in the moment, Strings just listened to what his dad’s guitar was saying.","When the time came to try it once more, Strings — now equipped with the melody in his head — “frickin’ nailed it,” he says.","Barber “was so proud, he just leaned over and squeezed my little hand. And that moment has pushed me to this day,” Strings says. “I still think about that. Like the other day when we won the Grammy, who did I call? I called my dad right away. Look dad, you taught me well.”","It’s clear Billy Strings’ name suits him well. Strings, born William Apostol, says his name came about from his Aunt Mondi, a woman whose vivacious life had a great impact on the young man. She dubbed him “Little Billy Strings” when he was a kid.","Mondi was on her deathbed during his teenage years, he says. On an unplanned visit to her house, he recalls how she got out of bed right away.","“And it wasn't long before the guitars got busted out, because Mondi always wanted to hear us play,” he says. “Man, it was just this crazy thing.”","Drinks and joints were in abundance at this extemporaneous music session, he says. She had been sober for about four or five years because of her illness, he says, but nothing could stop her from indulging in the joy of a night surrounded by good company and non-stop jams.","She died shortly after that night, he says. He had just started dabbling with open mic nights, so after her death, “when I went up to the chalkboard to write my name up there, I wrote Billy Strings in her honor,” he says.","The name has stuck ever since.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"2\" data-type=\"youtube\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","Strings spent a lot of time listening to rock and heavy metal as a teenager. His taste for an array of genres can be found steeped into the end of “Home,” a song that eclipses traditional bluegrass.","He describes Johnny Winter’s seamless guitar playing as having a “big impact” on him as a young musician. Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Pink Floyd were also significant influences.","“The psychedelia of Pink Floyd was really interesting, you know, like as a young kid with a very imaginative mind, listening to the album ‘The Dark Side of the Moon’ was like watching a movie,” he explains.","Strings’ song collection isn’t all strange sounds, effects and genre-mixing, though. He inserts pure bluegrass, like the song “Hollow Heart,” throughout his work “almost like a palate cleanser,” he says.","A dark energy can be felt vibrating through “Home.” Notably, the 4-minute-long instrumental “Guitar Peace” exudes a somber feeling throughout. Strings says one day, he got high and played a stream of consciousness, thus “Guitar Peace” was born.","“I just smoked a bunch of weed and tried to put something out,” he says.","While smoking cannabis often inspires him to pick up the guitar, he’s in no way reliant on the drug during the creative process, he says. If anything, weed helps the mood or the emotion of a song he’s crafting, he says.","Another melancholy song on the album, “Enough To Leave,” came to fruition after two of his friends died of heroin overdoses within about a week of each other. One of them was a buddy that helped Strings advance in the music scene.","“Man, I was just crushed,” he says. “So I just sat down and wrote that song and kind of wanted to do something for 'em. And that's kind of all I know how to do.”","\u003Cspan data-index=\"3\" data-type=\"youtube\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","Strings is currently occupied by another thing he knows how to do well, something he’s mastered at this point: living on a tour bus. Strings and his touring band, which includes artists on the banjo, bass and mandolin, are headed to Florida for a socially-distant concert, where fans in small pods can get lost in the music.","After, he’ll head to New Orleans, where he’ll perform on stage before a crowd of none. The show will be live streamed for people at home.","“I can't wait to play for people again. That's what I do. I know it's a release for a lot of those folks as it is for me,” he says. “Just getting able to get together with my band and playing music is such a blessing.”","\u003Chr \u002F\u003E","\u003Cem\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Finside\u002Fstaff\u002Femiko-tamagawa\"\u003EEmiko Tamagawa\u003C\u002Fa\u003E produced and edited this interview for broadcast with \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Finside\u002Fstaff\u002Ftinku-ray\"\u003ETinku Ray\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fserenaamcmahon\"\u003ESerena McMahon\u003C\u002Fa\u003E adapted it for the web.\u003C\u002Fem\u003E"],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.npr.org\u002Fsections\u002Fworld-cafe\u002F2020\u002F10\u002F08\u002F919484113\u002Fsomewhere-between-bluegrass-and-heavy-metal-billy-strings-discovered-his-own-sou","title":"Somewhere Between Bluegrass and Heavy Metal, Billy Strings Discovered His Own Sound","prefix":""},{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fhereandnow\u002F2021\u002F03\u002F17\u002Fgrammys-music-history","title":"How The Grammys Reflected This Moment In Music","prefix":""},{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fhereandnow\u002F2021\u002F01\u002F25\u002Fbela-fleck-bassekou-kouyate","title":"Béla Fleck’s Journey To Find Truth In Origins Of The Banjo","prefix":""},{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fhereandnow\u002F2021\u002F03\u002F12\u002Fdjesse-vol-3-jacob-collier","title":"Grammy-Nominated Artist Jacob Collier Defies Genre With 'Joyous' Sound","prefix":""},{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fhereandnow\u002F2019\u002F11\u002F22\u002Fblack-violin-hip-hop-classical-music","title":"Florida Duo 'Black Violin' Meshes Hip-Hop And Classical Music","prefix":""},{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fhereandnow\u002F2020\u002F10\u002F29\u002Fwilliam-prince-gospel-first-nation","title":"William Prince Blends Indigenous And Christian Roots In His Album 'Gospel First Nation'","prefix":""}],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"segment","broadcastDate":"2021-03-19 13:20:00","broadcastTime":"13:20:00","itunesEpType":"","itunesEpNum":0,"itunesTitle":"","itunesSummary":"","itunesExplicit":false,"volume":3,"disqus":null,"enableComments":false,"googlePick":false,"suppressAudio":false,"amp":true,"audioDatetime":"1616176182","pullquotes":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":72,"type":"category","name":"Music","description":"","slug":"music","series":false,"count":3031}],"audio":[{"id":98107,"createdAt":"2021-03-19 13:49:42","updatedAt":"2021-03-19 15:48:31","fileName":"hereandnow_0319_billy-strings-bluegrass-home","playCount":0,"airDate":"2021-03-19","source":"hereandnow","wordpressTitle":"Billy Strings' Journey From Learning Guitar In A Trailer With His Dad To Winning A Grammy","wordpressSlug":"billy-strings-bluegrass-home","status":"available","subType":"primary","audioLength":666,"nprCDNFilename":null,"description":"The 28 year old eclipses traditional bluegrass in his Grammy-winning album \"Home.\" ","megaphoneID":"7c31b7f8-88db-11eb-9bc5-db5febd92aae","megaphoneURL":"http:\u002F\u002Ftraffic.megaphone.fm\u002FBUR5681378755.mp3","articleAPIURL":"http:\u002F\u002Fapi.wbur.org\u002Fstories?id=669212&org=wbur","audioAPIURL":"http:\u002F\u002Fapi.wbur.org\u002Faudio\u002F98107","org":"wbur","orgKey":null,"audioMeta":[{"extension":"mp3","sizeInBytes":5326294,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fdts.podtrac.com\u002Fredirect.mp3\u002Ftraffic.megaphone.fm\u002FBUR5681378755.mp3"},{"extension":"mp4","sizeInBytes":5326294,"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fdts.podtrac.com\u002Fredirect.mp3\u002Fs3.amazonaws.com\u002Faudio.wbur.org\u002F2021\u002F03\u002Fhereandnow_0319_billy-strings-bluegrass-home.mp4"}]}],"embedMeta":{"embed-1":{"id":1,"parentID":669212,"type":"youtube","attributes":{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=EMXf3g6G7dA"},"body":"","placeholder":"\u003Cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"youtube\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E"},"embed-2":{"id":2,"parentID":669212,"type":"youtube","attributes":{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=_qaaA_umhcc"},"body":"","placeholder":"\u003Cspan data-index=\"2\" data-type=\"youtube\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E"},"embed-3":{"id":3,"parentID":669212,"type":"youtube","attributes":{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=3zzunMVvudw"},"body":"","placeholder":"\u003Cspan data-index=\"3\" data-type=\"youtube\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E"}},"images":[{"type":"featured","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2021\u002F03\u002Fbilly.jpg","width":1000,"height":667,"title":"Billy Strings.

She was getting questions from her patients who wanted to get the vaccine, but were left in the dark because of the lack of data on pregnant people.","“We take care of these women all the time, and they have questions about, ‘Well, if this wasn’t studied in people like me, do we know that it works? Is it safe?' So, the [study] was motivated by pragmatic, real life concerns that our patients have,” Edlow says. “Once the vaccines became available and pregnant and lactating women were making the choice to get them, we said, ‘Well of course, we need to study this.’”","\u003C!--more--\u003E","The study, which was published this month on \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.medrxiv.org\u002Fcontent\u002F10.1101\u002F2021.03.07.21253094v1.full.pdf\"\u003EmedrXiv.com\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, followed 131 women. Eighty-four of the participants were pregnant, 31 were lactating, and the rest were non-pregnant and non-lactating women between the ages of 18 and 45.","First, Edlow and her colleagues measured the level of antibodies in the participants before and after they received the vaccine and monitored them for any side effects. The goal was to answer the most basic question of whether the vaccines work in pregnant people.","Overall, Edlow says, the response of pregnant and lactating people to the vaccine was pretty much identical to the response of non-pregnant participants in the trial. They all experienced same levels of side effects and created similar amounts of antibodies that can neutralize and destroy the coronavirus.","“That was one really great point – it works. The vaccine works really well in pregnant women,” Edlow says.","Not only did Edlow discover high levels of protective antibodies in the women, but when 10 of the participants gave birth, the researchers were able to detect the same antibodies in all 10 of the babies’ umbilical cord blood. In particular, Edlow detected high levels of a flavor of antibody called an IgG antibody, which is associated with blood and tends to be more durable and long-lasting than other antibodies.","“There was one participant who only received one dose of a COVID vaccine [at the time of giving birth], and those antibody levels were lower in the umbilical cord blood,” Edlow says. “It seems like completing the two shots for many reasons, especially for the person’s health and safety but also to give higher doses of antibodies to the neonate, makes sense.”","People who have already given birth but were lactating when they received the vaccine are also likely transferring antibodies to their children through breast milk, Edlow adds. How exactly dousing the child’s mouth and intestinal tract with antibody-laden breast milk protects them is an area of ongoing research.","“One thing is they interact with the microbiome, the gut bacteria that are present, and can shape the baby’s immunity that way,” she says. “But we know that breastfeeding does give protection to babies and is probably complementary to the immune protection that babies receive through the umbilical cord.”","In particular, the scientists found that the breast milk contained the same IgG antibodies found in the umbilical cord blood and another type of antibody called IgA, typically associated with mucus membranes like the linings of the lungs, throat, mouth and nose. So, Edlow says, it’s also possible the antibodies stand guard on the surface of the baby’s membranes and prevent the virus from attacking that way.","“I have a friend who is currently breastfeeding. We talked about it, and I remember telling her she should get vaccinated and my hope was that she would be able to transfer antibodies to her baby,” says Dr. Sabrina Assoumou, an immunologist at Boston Medical Center who did not work on the study. “So, I bookmarked this study so that I could say, ‘See! Get vaccinated! You’re helping your little daughter.’”","While the study is a preprint and has not been formally peer-reviewed, Assoumou says she’s confident in the results for several reasons. First, there’s a pile of work showing that other vaccines allow antibodies to transfer through the placenta and breast milk.","“Biologically, it makes sense. We’ve seen it in other diseases. That’s why we vaccinate the mom [during pregnancy], to protect the baby from like pertussis, [diphtheria, tetanus] and influenza,” she says. “I’m always nervous about commenting on pre-prints, but this one, the science made sense, and I knew it was from a good group.”","It’s not clear how long these antibodies last in the newborn, however. So, mothers who have been vaccinated for COVID-19 should still plan to get their children vaccinated after they’re born, Edlow says.","And until the study is formally peer-reviewed, Edlow says the results probably shouldn’t be used to inform clinical decisions just yet. But that’s also why it’s important for pregnant and lactating people to be included in clinical trials in the first place, she adds.","“They are often some of the most vulnerable individuals, especially to respiratory pathogens [like the coronavirus],” she says. “[We should] protect pregnant women and lactating women through research, not protect them from research. Why not study this group, and why not let those individuals make the choice whether or not they think it’s too risky to participate?”"],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[{"url":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fcommonhealth\u002F2021\u002F01\u002F11\u002Fscientsts-seek-new-coronavirus-variant-in-massachusetts","title":"Scientists Hope To Find New Coronavirus Variant In Mass.

Since the last FERC meeting more than 60 organizations, companies, interest groups and individuals \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Felibrary.ferc.gov\u002FeLibrary\u002Fsearch\"\u003Ehave filed motions\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to become “intervenors” &mdash; essentially, legal participants in the proceeding. (The Sustainable FERC Project is one of them.)","The outcome of the briefing period remains unclear; FERC could vote to hold a hearing, or it could decide to take no action and let the compressor continue operating. But what is clear is that this uncertainty makes the situation more fraught.","Those in the gas industry, as well as those concerned about fossil fuel infrastructure, are left wondering about not only the future of the Weymouth Compressor, but also the fate of all other gas and pipeline projects.","“It seemed like the process was done. It seemed like it had all the approvals from [FERC] that it needed and those were final,” says \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.smu.edu\u002FLaw\u002FFaculty\u002FProfiles\u002FColeman-James-W\"\u003EJames Coleman\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, a FERC expert and law professor at Southern Methodist University. And so for FERC to potentially revisit it “is a big issue for really anybody interested in building energy infrastructure around the United States.”","Giannetti, of the Sustainable FERC Projects, agrees. Imagine you were a gas company with “a project that is built, in service and has a FERC certificate that's 4 years old, and then something happens at one of your compressor stations &mdash; some safety issue,” she says. “There's a concern that this is an attempt to reopen and relitigate FERC authorizations that happened in a different FERC, in a different era.”","\u003Cspan data-index=\"4\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","\u003Cstrong\u003EThe Dissenting Commissioners\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E","Two FERC commissioners &mdash; James Danly and Mark Christie &mdash; voted against the paper briefing process.

The first time my dad told the story, I didn’t pretend to know who this person was. Basketball has never been my thing.","Like a good millennial, I Googled Charles Barkley.

But that, I don’t know much about.","\"Your dad is one of the happiest people I’ve ever met in my life,\" Barkley said. \"I’m not just saying that — I mean, think about it: It’s fun to be with your friends, you know?

I know that basketball fans might say Barkley often does the same.","In June 2015, Barkley's mother passed away.

Afterward, he went to dinner with Barkley and his family.","\"For your dad to take the time to come to the funeral meant a great deal to me,\" Barkley said.","Then, in May 2016, my dad was diagnosed with cancer. He had tumors in his heart.","I took that fall off from school. My dad and I watched mobster movies together. Action movies. Kung Fu movies. When the credits rolled, we’d flip to a basketball game.

The Golden State Warriors vs. the Cleveland Cavaliers. My dad was staying in palliative care at the hospital. He loved the Warriors.

And not just a thoughtful guy — but someone people trusted for advice. I realized that, even after he passed away, I would continue to learn things about my dad.","Before Barkley and I hung up, he had one more thing to say:","\"Hey, listen. You stay in touch. Please tell your mom I said hello. Give her a big kiss. Tell your brother I said hello. And listen: Just keep doing you. It’s your time now. Don’t forget that.

What happened at that moment is the subject of \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.amazon.com\u002FAmbassadors-Dog-Scott-H-DeLisi\u002Fdp\u002F9937733227\"\u003E\"The Ambassador's Dog,\"\u003C\u002Fa\u003E a book he's written for children and adults.","DeLisi was several days into a group trek through what was once an ancient kingdom on the Tibetan plateau. At about 12,000 feet high, the group paused before finishing the final ascent up to the ancient monastery of Lo Gekar.","Looking hillside toward the small village of Saukre, DeLisi spotted a puppy whose dusty fur camouflaged with the color of the Earth in the Mustang region of Nepal.","“It's as if the dust that was always being blown in the wind had embedded itself into this puppy's coat,” he says.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","But DeLisi could clearly see the dog — all because of his mesmerizing blue eyes.","The breed, common for the area, are the dogs Marco Polo encountered on his trip to China, DeLisi says.","DeLisi vividly remembers the puppy, who he soon named Lo Khyi, calling out and speaking to him. The dog summoned DeLisi to a perch by calling him “dai,” which means older brother.","“That pup jumped onto my lap and he licked my hands. And then he put his paws on my shoulder and he licked me on the cheek and he looked me in the eye and he said, ‘Dai, you do not know this, but I'm your dog,’ ” DeLisi says. “I said, ‘You may be right.’ ”","DeLisi understands many might not understand how a dog spoke to him — even his own family debates him on the occurrence.","“But I have to remind them that [dogs] do speak. We just have to know how to listen,” he says. “And maybe if there's one thing I've learned over the years as a diplomat, that ability to listen, making the effort to hear what is truly being said and to embrace what you are experiencing, that's part of the key. The puppy spoke to me.”","As DeLisi talked with the dog, a member of his staff came up to him, asking what was going on. The staff member reminded the ambassador he was up 12,000 feet in thin air and said the puppy wasn’t speaking to him.","“And I had to explain very gently to this young man. I said, ‘Son, shut up. I'm having a good conversation with the dog,’ ” he says.","With other tasks ahead of the group, they had to move on. But he says as the group descended back through the village again, the puppy was sitting there, waiting for DeLisi’s return.","DeLisi soon learned that a young boy had found the tiny puppy, shivering and near death, either abandoned or lost from its litter. The boy took him back to the village where the community fed the dog tsampa, a barley porridge.","Nourished, the puppy was free to play and roam the village, but never truly belonged to one person. DeLisi asked the village’s de facto mayor at the time whether the dog was for sale.","“He looked at me and he said, ‘Excellency, you must understand the word for dog is khyi, which is also the word for happiness. So we do not sell them. We give them as gifts,’ ” DeLisi recalls.","As a gift in return, DeLisi gave him all the rupees he had in his pocket, maybe $39 worth, he says. The dog, placed in his arms, looked up at DeLisi and reminded him once more that the two belonged together, he says, “and the rest is history.”","To document the extraordinary experience, DeLisi tapped illustrator Jane Lillian Vance to help tell the story in “The Ambassador’s Dog.” Vance had traveled to Nepal before and used her trip to guide the book’s art.","She took in the vibrant sights around her — black spiral fossilized ammonites, sea buckthorn berries, cobalt blue poppies and a plethora of colorful rocks, she says.","“I found six colors of rock, which I brought back with me to Virginia and pulverized into silt and mixed with clear, transparent oil paint like clear toothpaste,” she says, which she used to paint the scenery within the pages of “The Ambassador's Dog.”","DeLisi, who has the original “vibrant” illustrations, says the connection to the Earth within these paintings makes them come alive. He can feel the texture of the grain when touching the image.","“Those paintings become the Braille of the Himalayas, which you can touch and read here,” Vance says.","“The Ambassador's Dog” serves as a work of art — a telling of a story that goes beyond one man finding a stray dog. DeLisi found purpose and learned lessons through the experience.","In his years as a diplomat, he says he discovered that setting aside preconceived notions and being open to hearing what others have to say was “always more effective than if I went in with just a set of talking points and a very narrow perspective on where we were going to go in the conversation.”","Finding and being open to listening to Lo Khyi, he says, actively reinforced those notions.","Now he can take a tiny bit of Nepal’s beauty with him wherever he goes, with Lo Khyi by his side and his book in arm.","“Nepal, for many people, it's that Shangri-La of legend. There was something magical and mystical about the country,” he says. “And I think that this is a little bit of a tribute to a country that was very special to both of us as we made our own journeys through life.”","\u003Ch2\u003EBook Excerpt: 'The Ambassador's Dog'\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E","\u003Cem\u003EBy Scott DeLisi\u003C\u002Fem\u003E","The people of the village recognized that this handsome blue-gray puppy had a wandering spirit. And, although the people were kind, the puppy sensed that none of them were the family of which he had dreamed. And so he waited. And every day he gazed down the trail that led back to Tsarang and then to a world beyond the plateau.\u003Cbr \u002F\u003EKarchung had never been beyond the village of Tsarang. Neither had his parents. Nor had most of the people of the village. They were content with their lives in the mountains.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"2\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","The chickens, the goats, and the donkeys the pup met had never left the mountains either. They had no desire to do so. They too were content with their lives high on the plateau and with their homes in Saukre. But the puppy - the bhote kukur born in the heart of those mountains - knew that his future lay down the trail and beyond. And so, he waited. He knew his dreams would find him and he would find his dreams.","The puppy waited quietly. He waited with dignity. Calmly. Sure that his future lay down the path he watched so intently every day.","The people of Saukre worried that the restless spirit in the puppy would lead him to follow some call only he heard and take him far away from them. So they used a khata, a ceremonial silk blessing scarf, to tie the puppy to a metal rod pounded into the ground on the edge of the trail. But the pup did not mind. He sat. He waited. He watched.","The days passed. Then, one morning, when the pup awoke, the air around him was alive with energy. Karchung did not feel it. The chickens scratching in the dirt did not feel it. The goats wandering through the lanes did not feel it. But the puppy felt it, and his heart raced.","He gobbled down his tsampa and then went out into the day. The worst of the winter chills were gone but a fog still shrouded Saukre early that April morning. The blue-gray pup was almost invisible, blending into the drifting wisps of mist as he raced for his perch overlooking the trail. Karchung knew where the pup was bound and followed along behind. As he had every day for the past week, he tied the pup to the metal rod. The pup did not mind. He sat on his rock, looked down the trail, and waited. The sun rose higher and the mists gave way to a blue sky that matched the puppy’s eyes. The village had come alive as the morning passed. Everyone was in motion. Except the pup. He still waited.","At ten o’clock, people in the village stopped for tea. But the pup waited. Every nerve was tingling. He sat so straight. So strong. So handsome. And he waited. Suddenly, the pup sat even straighter, if such a thing was possible. There. In the distance. People were moving. They came closer and closer and closer. In front was a man. A man in a white shirt wearing a blue cap.","His white beard spoke of the passage of years, but the fact that he hiked in these high mountain passes told the pup that his spirit was strong. The man’s eyes were kind and his voice gentle. The puppy knew that this was his man. This was why he had waited. He knew it, even if the man did not.","The pup mustered all the dignity that a five-week-old puppy could muster. He sat still. But his heart raced. He met the man’s eyes and held them and, for the first time, the puppy spoke.”","\u003Chr \u002F\u003E","\u003Cem\u003EExcerpted from \"The Ambassador's Dog\" by Scott DeLisi.
