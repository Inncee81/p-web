of the best ways to keep your cryptocurrency safe is to use a hardware wallet—a secure hardware device for storing your private keys. Unlike web and mobile wallets, a hardware wallet can't be hacked without having access to the device itself, meaning there's one less way that your funds can be stolen.\n\nThe Ledger Nano S is one of the best-known crypto hardware wallets, having sold well over a million units worldwide. But does it still cut it in 2021?\n\nWHAT IS THE LEDGER NANO S?\n\nAt $59, the Ledger Nano S is one of the cheaper hardware wallets on the market. It supports more than 1,100 cryptocurrencies, and has a sleek design and simple user interface.\n\nBut it's coming up for its fifth birthday in 2021—an eternity in tech hardware terms—and it's since been superseded by its feature-packed sibling, the Ledger Nano X.\n\nSo is it worth shelling out for the extra bells and whistles, or does the simpler, cheaper option still have what it takes? We've taken a detailed look at the setup process and what it’s like to use the wallet.\n\nLEDGER NANO S: DESIGN AND BUILD\n\nThe Ledger Nano S isn't going to win any design awards, but neither does it have the clunky aesthetic of rival hardware wallets like the Trezor One.\n\n\"Discreet\" is probably the best word to describe it; indeed, if it weren't for the Ledger branding etched on its aluminum shield, you could easily mistake it for an old—if slightly chunky—USB flash drive.\n\nRotate it open, however, and some differences immediately become apparent: there's a (tiny) screen, a micro-USB socket and two buttons atop the device for navigating its menus.\n[Ledger Nano S]The Ledger Nano S is available in a variety of different colors. Image: Decrypt\nThe Nano S is available in a variety of colorways, including green, pink, and a rather fetching transparent model. As well as letting you coordinate your Ledger with your wardrobe and interior decor, it's also handy for distinguishing between main and backup devices (or, if you're a crypto high roller who wants to split up their holdings, between different accounts).\n\nLEDGER NANO S: WHAT'S IN THE BOX?\n\nThe Nano S packaging is simple, minimalist, and clearly draws inspiration from Apple's designs. Unlike some manufacturers, Ledger doesn't bother with an anti-tamper seal—it argues that the seals are easy to counterfeit and can be misleading.\n[We review the Ledger Nano S to see if it deserves to be one of the top ranking crypto hardware wallets.]The Ledger Nano S has an Apple-esque vibe. Photo Credit: Decrypt\nInside the box, you'll find the Nano S device itself, along with a quick start guide, three cards for recording your recovery phrase, a micro-USB cable, a lanyard, and a loop for attaching your Nano S to a keyring.\n\nLEDGER NANO S: GETTING STARTED\n\nTo set up the Ledger Nano S, you'll first need to download and install the Ledger Live application; upon launch, you'll need to set up a password.\n\nOnce you've done that, connect your Ledger to your computer using the supplied micro-USB cable, and follow the on-screen prompts to set up your device.  Most of the next steps are made on the device itself, and are (initially) straightforward—the only thing you'll need to do is set up a PIN.\n\nTo navigate through the menus, use the two buttons on top of the device; click the right button to go right/up, the left button to go left/down and both buttons to select a menu item or respond to a prompt.\n[We review the Ledger Nano S to see if it deserves to be one of the top ranking crypto hardware wallets.]The Ledger hardware wallet makes great use of just two buttons and a small screen. Image: Decrypt\nThe next step is a little more arduous. The Ledger generates a 24-word secret phrase, which you'll need to record on one of the cards supplied with the device. That means clicking through to each word, copying it down, double-checking to make sure it's accurate, and then re-entering the words to confirm that you've recorded them correctly.\n\nIt's a tedious process, but necessary; in a very real sense, the 24-word phrase _is_ your wallet, and the Ledger simply provides a portal through which you access it. If you lose your Ledger device (or forget your PIN number), you can enter the recovery phrase on a new Ledger, and still have access to your crypto assets. If you lose your recovery phrase, you're stuffed.\n\nBest Crypto Wallet: Overview of the 9 Best Hardware Wallets (2020)\nSome wallets require you to enter your secret phrase into an app, which then sends it to the device—meaning the hardware wallet is pointless if your phone is hacked or stolen. By keeping the secret phrase airlocked and only held on the Ledger device, security is maximized.\n\nThat also means you need to keep your recovery phrase _very_ secure. Some Ledger users have resorted to recording their 24 words in a metal wallet (card, after all, can be burned or disintegrate in water), or splitting their recovery phrase up and storing it in multiple locations.\n\nOnce you've chosen a PIN and recorded your recovery phrase, you'll need to verify your device through the Ledger Live app, which should take just a few seconds.\n\nLEDGER LIVE\n\nThe Ledger Live software is, for most users, the main way you'll interact with your Ledger Nano S. Fortunately, it's a beautiful, streamlined app that is very easy to use.\n\nUnlike the Nano X, which has Bluetooth connectivity and an internal battery, you'll need to connect the Nano S to your computer via a micro-USB cable in order to use Ledger Live. You can also use the Nano S with Ledger Live's Android mobile app, using the Ledger OTG kit.\n\nEach time you plug the device in, you'll need to enter your PIN code.\n\nThe first thing you'll need to do on launching is to add some apps to your Ledger. To do this, navigate to \"settings\" in the left-hand column of Ledger Live. You'll be prompted to \"allow Ledger Manager\" on your device. Here you can check whether your device has the latest firmware (and update it if necessary), and add or update apps.\n\nApps essentially represent cryptocurrency coins or tokens; Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cosmos and so forth. When you install the relevant app, you'll need to add an account; this will then show up in the \"portfolio\" section of Ledger Live.\n\nOnce you've installed your apps, you can send and receive crypto. To receive, you can either navigate to the \"Accounts\" section and pick whichever account you want to use, or use the \"send\" and \"receive\" buttons in the sidebar and select your chosen cryptocurrency from the drop-down menu.\n\nYou'll also need to open the app for the relevant cryptocurrency on your Nano S device.\n\nTo send or receive, you'll need to confirm the sending or receiving address on your Ledger Nano S. This can be a fiddly business; it involves checking the address in Ledger Live against the characters on the Ledger's tiny screen (which is so small it can't render the entire address on one screen, forcing you to click through to see the whole thing).\n\nThat's the most painful part of the process, though; once you've done that, it's plain sailing. Sending and receiving crypto is a smooth process; Ledger Live also offers options for buying and selling certain cryptocurrencies directly in the app.\n\nLEDGER NANO S: EASE OF USE AND FEATURES\n\nYou're not just limited to using the Nano S with Ledger Live, however. The hardware wallet can also be used in conjunction with web wallets, such as MetaMask, MyEtherWallet, and MyCrypto.\n\nYou can also use the Nano S as a security key for two-factor authentication, by installing the FIDO U2F app. This enables you to verify your login credentials using your hardware wallet on a number of different web services, including Google, Facebook, GitHub and Dropbox.\n\nThere's also a recovery check app, which enables you to check that you've recorded your recovery phrase accurately without requiring you to reset your Ledger.\n\nLEDGER NANO S: SUPPORTED ASSETS\n\nThe Ledger Nano S supports over 1,100 crypto assets, 29 of which you can manage directly using Ledger Live. Some of the coins and tokens available include:\n\n \t* Bitcoin (BTC)\n \t* Ethereum (ETH) and ERC20 tokens\n \t* XRP\n \t* Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\n \t* Litecoin (LTC)\n \t* Tether (USDT)\n \t* Binance Coin (BNB)\n \t* EOS\n \t* Stellar (XLM)\n \t* Cardano (ADA)\n \t* Monero (XMR)\n \t* Cosmos (ATOM)\n \t* Polkadot (DOT)\n\nHowever, because of the limited storage capacity of the Nano S, you'll only be able to run two or three of the relevant wallet apps on the device at any one time. If you have a diverse portfolio, you might want to consider the Nano X as an alternative, as its expanded internal memory means that it's able to store a lot more apps at once.\n\nLEDGER NANO S: SECURITY\n\nObviously the most important part of a hardware wallet is its security credentials, and Ledger hasn't skimped in that regard. Like the Nano X and Ledger Blue, the Nano S has a physically isolated secure element that's CC EAL5+ certified—the highest such rating available against penetration tests.\n\nThese secure elements are similar to those used in credit cards, passports and SIM cards; in addition, Ledger uses its own proprietary operating system, BOLOS. This ensures that the various applications running on the Nano S, and the 24-word recovery phrase, are isolated from each other, and requires that physical confirmation for each transaction needs to take place.\n\nThe Nano S and Nano X are also the only hardware wallets to receive CSPN (First Level Security Certificate) certification, from ANSSI—the National Cybersecurity Agency of France.\n\nWhile Ledger's physical security is extremely tight—making it one of the most secure cold storage solutions on the market—Ledger the company has had some embarrassing security lapses in the past.\n\n\u003e Recently, we shared news of a data dump. On December 23, we were alerted by our e-commerce provider Shopify about an incident in April \u0026 June '20 where their rogue team members exported merchants' customer databases. Ledger was included. More details: https://t.co/NHU3IbDL0a pic.twitter.com/DHQQ9arxCu\n\u003e \n\u003e — Ledger (@Ledger) January 13, 2021\n\nNotably, in June 2020, data from its e-commerce database was leaked, with over a million customer records finding their way to hacker forums. As a result, some Ledger customers found themselves at the mercy of phishing attacks, and even threats.\n\nAs a result, Ledger has committed to changing its procedures for handling customer data, though it's scant comfort to those who have had their personal information (and the fact that they hold enough cryptocurrency for it to be worth securing in cold storage) exposed.\n\nLEDGER NANO S REVIEW: VERDICT\n\nIt may be getting a bit long in the tooth, but at just $59, the Ledger Nano S is a steal—either as a backup device if you already own a Nano X, or as a cold storage solution in its own right.\n\nLedger Nano X Review (2021): An Expensive Step In The Right Direction\nIts main limitations are its storage capacity (meaning that you can only run two or three apps on it at any given time), its tiny screen, and the fact that you need to plug it into a computer to use it. All of these are addressed by the Ledger Nano X, though the extra $60 is quite a steep price increase for the upgrade.\n\nFor most people, especially those with a small portfolio of crypto assets, the Nano S is a reliable workhorse, and all the wallet you'll need.\n\nRATING: 4/5\n","read_this_next_post_id":"6907","read_this_next_post_type":"post","social_share_img_url":"https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ledger-nano-s-review-main-2-gID_7.jpg","featured_image_caption":"The Ledger Nano S hardware wallet.

cryptocurrencies were invented over a decade ago, there have been many attempts to build more advanced, secure and user-friendly walletsto store them.\n\nAs of 2021, the current gold standard for security is known as a hardware wallet—a physical device that stores your cryptocurrency private keys in a secure offline environment.\n\nOne of the most prominent companies involved in moving the needle forward is Ledger, the firm behind the popular, but flawed Ledger Nano S hardware wallet—and the Ledger Nano X, its flagship device.\n\nWith a bigger screen, Bluetooth connectivity and a built-in battery, the Nano X is certainly an upgrade—but does it live up to the hype? Let's find out.\n\nLEDGER NANO X REVIEW: DESIGN AND BUILD\n\n [Ledger Nano X review: design and build]The Ledger Nano X is twice the size—and weight—of the Nano S (Image: Decrypt)\nAt 72mm x 18.6mm x 11.75mm with a weight of 34g, the Ledger Nano X is almost twice as large and more than twice as heavy as the Ledger Nano S.\n\nOne reason for the Nano X's greater bulk is that it has a built-in 100mAH battery, meaning that you can use it on the move—unlike its predecessor, which had to be plugged into a PC using a USB cable to draw power. Also filling out its frame are increased memory and a larger OLED screen.\n\nAs we can see, although the Ledger Nano X is far smaller than the KeepKey wallet and the Ledger Blue, it is noticeably larger than the Nano S and Trezor Model One. Nonetheless, it is still an incredibly small device, and is roughly comparable in size to a common USB pen drive.\n\nOverall, the Ledger Nano X has a modern aesthetic that is similar to the Ledger Nano S, albeit more streamlined, since the buttons are now built into the body of the device and sit flush with the casing.\n[Ledger Nano X review: size comparison]The Ledger Nano X may be hefty, but it's comparable to other wallets (Image: Decrypt) \n\nLEDGER NANO X REVIEW: WHAT'S IN THE BOX?\n\nThe Ledger Nano X comes supplied in a small cellophane-wrapped box, measuring approximately 80mm x 131mm x 31mm. Interestingly, Ledger chooses not to use tamper-evident seals on its packaging, stating that they're \"easy to counterfeit and can therefore be misleading.\"\n\nInside the box, you'll find the Ledger Nano X device (obviously), in addition to a braided USB A to USB C cable and a keychain strap. Documentation includes a getting started leaflet, three recovery sheets (for recording recovery phrases) as well as several stickers featuring Ledger branding.\n\nLEDGER NANO X REVIEW: EASE OF USE\n\n [Ledger Nano X review: ease of use]The Ledger Nano X's large screen and controls make it easier to use (Image: Decrypt)\nThe Nano X may be heftier than the Nano S, but it's still a small device. As a result, navigating through the on-device menu isn't exactly the simplest process in the world—particularly when considering the fact that it only has two buttons. However, the larger screen and controls make for a significantly less fiddly user experience than that of the Ledger Nano S.\n\nNavigating the device's menu involves scrolling left or right using the left and right button respectively, or selecting options by pressing both buttons simultaneously. Beyond this, most of the action actually occurs on the associated Ledger Live application, with the Ledger device itself being mostly used for verifying addresses and authorizing transactions.\n\nThe Ledger Nano X's larger screen resolves one of the most common gripes about the Nano S, since crypto addresses can now be displayed in their entirety instead of requiring you to scroll. One niggling issue is that the Nano X ships with a relatively short USB cable—just 50cm long, which can make it difficult to use if your computer isn't in a convenient location.\n\nLEDGER NANO X REVIEW: GETTING STARTED\n\n [Ledger Live]To get started, you'll need to use the Ledger Live app (Image: Ledger)\nTo begin using the device, you'll first need to download and install the Ledger Live client for your operating system. This is currently available for most desktop operating systems including Windows, Mac OS, Linux, as well as mobile operating systems like iOS and Android.\n\nOnce Ledger Live is up and running, you can power up the Ledger Nano X device by holding the left button, after which you'll be able to navigate through the startup screens to configure the device.\n\nThis will involve choosing a 4 to 8 digit PIN code, and backing up and verifying the randomly generated 24-word recovery phrase shown on the device. Overall, this process takes around 5 to 10 minutes, and only needs to be completed once.\n\nBy default, the device doesn't ship with any preinstalled wallet apps. Instead, these need to be manually downloaded by connecting the Ledger Nano X with Ledger Live. Thanks to its Bluetooth capabilities, the Ledger Nano X is able to pair with mobile devices running Ledger Live wirelessly; if you're using the device with a desktop PC, you'll have to use the supplied USB cable.\n\nLEDGER NANO X REVIEW: FEATURES\n\n [Ledger Nano X review: apps]The Ledger Nano X can store up to 100 apps simultaneously (Image: Decrypt)\nAs a hardware wallet, the Ledger Nano X is primarily designed for the safe storage of cryptocurrencies and other crypto assets. Because of this, the Ledger Nano X is compatible with practically every major cryptoasset, while support for new assets is added regularly.\n\nThe Ledger Nano X also overcomes one of the major limitations of its Ledger Nano S, by bumping the available internal memory from 320kb up to 2048kb. This allows users to store up to 100 apps on their device at once—considerably more than the 3 to 7 simultaneous apps the Ledger Nano S could hold. This means the Ledger Nano X can currently hold the entire app library simultaneously—avoiding the need to manually remove and switch out apps due to memory constraints.\n\nWhile the vast majority of these apps allow the wallet to hold additional cryptocurrencies and tokens, a handful impart additional functionality to the Nano X. For example, the FIDO U2F app turns the device into a two-factor authentication key, whereas the recovery check app can be used to ensure you have correctly saved your recovery phrase.\n\n Ledger Nano S Review (2021): Still The Best Hardware Wallet?\n\nMoreover, the Ledger Nano X is the first cryptocurrency hardware wallet to include a built-in 100mAH battery, a necessary upgrade since the device now features Bluetooth connectivity out of the box. This allows the device to connect to mobile devices wirelessly, whereas the older Ledger Nano S could only connect to mobile devices using a Ledger OTG Kit.\n\nWith the addition of wireless connectivity, increased memory, and a much larger screen, Ledger has clearly paid attention to the shortcomings of its earlier products and is trying to make safely storing crypto assets a less challenging task.\n\nLEDGER NANO X REVIEW: SUPPORTED CRYPTO ASSETS\n\n [Ledger apps]The Ledger Nano X can store over 1,000 crypto assets (Image: Ledger)\nThe Ledger Nano X is compatible with well over 1,000 digital assets, including 23 coins and all ERC-20 tokens. Many of these can be managed through Ledger Live, whereas some require the Ledger Nano X to be used in conjunction with a compatible wallet. Supported crypto assets include;\n\n \t* Bitcoin (BTC)\n \t* Ethereum (ETH) and ERC20 tokens\n \t* XRP\n \t* Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\n \t* Litecoin (LTC)\n \t* Tether (USDT)\n \t* Binance Coin (BNB)\n \t* EOS\n \t* Stellar (XLM)\n \t* Cardano (ADA)\n \t* Monero (XMR)\n \t* Cosmos (ATOM)\n \t* Polkadot (DOT)\n \t* and over 1,000 more\n\nThe Ledger Nano X supports practically every crypto asset supported by the Ledger Nano S, but is able to hold more of the relevant wallet apps at any one time thanks to its expanded internal memory.\n\nAs such, the Ledger Nano X is ideal for securing diverse portfolios, though individuals looking to store newly released crypto assets may need to wait until Ledger adds support for them.\n\nLEDGER NANO X REVIEW: SECURITY\n\n [Ledger Nano X review: Security]The Ledger Nano X incorporates security features including a CC EAL5+ physically isolated security element (Image: Decrypt)\nAs a hardware wallet, the Ledger Nano X targets the minority of cryptocurrency users that value security above all else. As such, the team behind the product has clearly put a great deal of thought into the potential ways such a device could be attacked, and have incorporated a huge number of potential safeguards into its design.\n\nLike all Ledger devices, the Nano X features state-of-the-art security and incorporates a physically isolated security element certified as CC EAL5+. These secure elements are similar to those used to secure credit and debit cards, and are the standard used by banks for the protection of financial information.\n\nThe device also features a dual-core MCU which runs a proprietary operating system known as BOLOS and controls communication between the connected device and the Ledger secure element.\n\nAlthough the addition of Bluetooth theoretically increases the number of potential entry points hackers could use to compromise the device, the Ledger Nano X encrypts Bluetooth traffic between the mobile device and requires manual verification for all important device actions.\n\nBeyond this, Ledger's Nano X and Nano S are the only hardware wallets to receive CSPN (First Level Security Certificate) certification, which means their security has been independently certified by ANSSI—the National Cybersecurity Agency of France.\n\nThese hardware-based security measures are also supplemented with several software-based ones, including a 4-8 digital security PIN, automatic inactivity lockouts and an optional Ledger Live password lock.\n\nOverall, the Ledger Nano X is without question one of the most secure cold storage solutions on the market.\n\nHowever, although its devices offer a high level of security, Ledger has experienced some security lapses as a company.\n\nIn June 2020, data from the company's e-commerce database was leaked, resulting in over a million customer records being posted to hacker forums. Some quarter of a million records included details such as physical addresses and phone numbers—exposing Ledger customers to the threat of phishing attacks and even threats.\n\n\u003e Recently, we shared news of a data dump. On December 23, we were alerted by our e-commerce provider Shopify about an incident in April \u0026 June '20 where their rogue team members exported merchants' customer databases. Ledger was included. More details: https://t.co/NHU3IbDL0a pic.twitter.com/DHQQ9arxCu\n\u003e \n\u003e — Ledger (@Ledger) January 13, 2021\n\nWhile Ledger has committed to changing how it handles customer data and identifying and prosecuting those responsible, it's an embarrassing lapse for a company whose business is the security of your crypto.\n\nLEDGER NANO X REVIEW: VERDICT\n\nThe Ledger Nano X is currently available for purchase from the official Ledger website for $119. With that said, it can often be found for cheaper at authorized third-party retailers as well as official resellers on Amazon. You should exercise caution when purchasing any hardware wallet, making sure to only purchase from authorized sources, and never using any hardware wallet that has already been configured.\n\nAt twice the price of the Ledger Nano S, the Nano X is one of the more expensive hardware wallets on the market. If portability and usability are your top concerns, it's probably worth the hit on your wallet—but if you're already happy with the Ledger Nano S, there's little reason to upgrade.\n\nThe addition of Bluetooth and massively expanded internal memory are steps in the right direction, whereas the huge range of supported cryptocurrencies means that even the most diverse cryptocurrency investors can secure their entire portfolio.\n\nThe Ledger Nano X  is an excellent product marred only by its high price tag; those in the market for a less expensive alternative may want to take a look at the cheaper, but dated Ledger Nano S.\n\nRATING: 4/5\n","read_this_next_post_id":"16272","read_this_next_post_type":"post","social_share_img_url":"https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ledger-nano-x-review-main-gID_7.jpg","featured_image_caption":"Ledger Nano X (Image: Decrypt)","featured_image_description":"Ledger Nano X (Image: Decrypt)","featured_image_url":"https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ledger-nano-x-review-main-gID_7.jpg","primary_category":{"term_id":26172,"name":"Reviews","slug":"reviews","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":26172,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Editorial reviews and ratings for blockchain and cryptocurrency products.","parent":0,"count":0,"filter":"raw"}}},{"id":44416,"date":"2021-02-26T16:25:18","date_gmt":"2021-02-26T16:25:18","guid":{"rendered":"https://wp.decrypt.co/?p=44416"},"modified":"2021-02-26T16:29:04","modified_gmt":"2021-02-26T16:29:04","slug":"brave-web-browser-review","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://wp.decrypt.co/44416/brave-web-browser-review/","title":{"rendered":"Brave Browser Review (2021): Earn Tokens While Browsing"},"content":{"rendered":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eDo you remember the dark days of Internet Explorer?

In essence, IPFS is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol which allows users to browse the Internet in a different way to standard HTTP.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we use HTTP or HTTPS, our browsers use URLs to access sites that are based on centralized servers. This means that your distance to these servers affects how long it takes to load a page, and their centralized nature puts control of the information in other peoples’ hands. The fact that certain governments can easily block access to certain sites and information is an example of one of the main problems with the standard HTTP/S route.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe title=\"How to Use IPFS With the Brave Browser\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hpwh_zLpnCE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIPFS, on the other hand, distributes site data across a network, in a similar vein to things like BitTorrent and blockchain, accessing content through URIs (Universal Resource Indicators) instead of URLs. In this instance, your device acts as a node that stores website data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you load up an IPFS website then, you’re actually loading it up from other nodes on the network. Not only does this result in faster loading times and streaming speeds, but it’ll also mean that websites won’t go offline for everyone if a single server goes offline. Crucially, it also gives power back to the people, preventing censorship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"embedded-post\" data-id=57109 data-post-title=\"Decrypt Diaries: Why We Built on IPFS\" data-post-type=\"post\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://wp.decrypt.co/57109/decrypt-diaries-why-we-built-on-ipfs/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003eDecrypt Diaries: Why We Built on IPFS\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a \u003ca href=\"https://brave.com/ipfs-support/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003efew options available\u003c/a\u003e if you want to load IPFS content through Brave.

you remember the dark days of Internet Explorer? We do. In the face of its slow, buggy, and downright unpleasant interface, the arrival of alternative browsers like Firefox and Google Chrome was an absolute godsend. \n\nNow there’s a (relatively) new kid on the block, and it’s powered by crypto: Brave Browser.\n\nWHAT IS BRAVE BROWSER?\n\nBrave Browser is a privacy-first, crypto-powered browser that blocks websites from tracking you by default.\n\nLaunching a new browser into the current marketplace might seem like a fool’s errand for Brave. Google Chrome, the market leader, has gobbled up nearly two-thirds of the global market share. Apple’s Safari comes in a distant second, with 19%, while Mozilla’s Firefox brings up the rear at 4%. \n\nBrave, however, reckons that its focus on user privacy sets it apart from the competition. Forged by the creator of JavaScript and co-founder of the Mozilla Project, Brendan Eich (who was also responsible for Firefox), Brave’s primary goal is to redefine how we think about browsing the web, by blocking websites from tracking you, and rewarding you with cold, hard crypto for watching ads instead.\n\nThat’s right: Brave users can actually earn revenue in the form of Basic Attention Token (BAT) by opting to view anonymous, privacy-preserving ads. The company’s ad network, which launched in November 2019, provides users with an option to watch these anonymous ads, before being paid in BAT. The service is optional, and you’re more than welcome to leave all ads blocked and turned off if you wish. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves.\n\nWe’ve put Brave through its paces to see what it’s really like to use as a daily driver. Is it fast? Does it have all the features you need? Is it good enough to replace Chrome? \n\nLet’s find out.\n\nDESIGN AND UX: FAMILIAR TO CHROME USERS \n\n [Brave browser home screen]Brave's look and feel is immediately familiar to Chrome users. Image: Brave\nThe first time you fire up Brave on either its mobile or desktop iterations, you’ll be hard-pressed to spot any difference if you’re coming from Chrome. That’s no coincidence—Brave is built on top of the open-source Chromium web browser that Google’s own Chrome is based on.\n\nFrom a UI and ease of use standpoint, that means the switch to Brave is essentially a painless one for existing Chrome users, with everything situated where you’d expect it to be. Given the basic nature of web browsers in general, you won’t struggle with navigation if you’re coming from another browser either.\n\nThankfully Brave also has a built-in dark mode, which we’d strongly recommend regardless of what device you’re using it on. Treat your eyes to darker menus and UI layouts, and you’ll never want to go back to the world of piercing white screens ever again.\n\nGETTING STARTED WITH BRAVE BROWSER\n\nBefore you dive straight into the wonderful world of cat gifs and Reddit, it’s worth spending a few minutes setting everything up, for a smoother, more fully-featured experience. \n\nThe first thing to do is import your bookmarks, which is as easy as going to ‘Bookmarks’ and selecting the option to—you guessed it—import bookmarks. Choose Chrome (or any other browser you want to import information from), and, well, that’s pretty much it.\n\nBrave’s bonanza year, and why 2020 promises to be better still\nIf you’re fully embracing Brave’s focus on privacy, you might also want to ditch Google as the default search engine and pick a less data-thirsty alternative, like DuckDuckGo, instead. Simply hit up settings, then ‘Search engine’ and select your preferred service. \n\nThe last basic thing you might want to do is to sync up your desktop and mobile versions of Brave so that you can easily continue your sessions from one to the other, while sharing bookmarks and other preferences in the process. Go to settings, ‘Sync’ and ‘Add new device’.\n\n Privacy Browser Brave Now Available From the Dark Web\n\nBrave’s sync feature can be a little clunky compared to that of Chrome, requiring you to set up a “sync chain” of devices by scanning a QR code or entering a 24-word keyphrase. It’s nowhere near as slick as rivals’ offerings, which simply require you to log in; it’s also not yet available for iOS users.\n\nHOW EASY IS BRAVE BROWSER TO USE?\n\nDespite Brave’s big push for privacy and blocking regular ads and trackers, there are no complicated hoops you need to jump through to benefit from these all-important core privacy features.\n\nBrave blocks trackers and ads as standard straight out of the box, and there’s something incredibly satisfying about being able to see just how much you’re thwarting nefarious data mining practices—but more on that later.\n\nGiven Brave’s Chromium DNA, you can also install whatever Chrome extension you fancy, supercharging your browsing experience any way you see fit. Thanks to the shared platform, installing extensions is as easy as visiting the Chrome web store, and clicking ‘Add to Brave’. No side-loading, no workarounds, no compatibility issues. It’s as simple as that.\n\nBRAVE BROWSER SPEED TEST: FASTER THAN THE COMPETITION?\n\nOn both PC and mobile, we noticed no dramatic speed differences between Brave and Chrome. We wouldn’t say Brave felt much or noticeably faster in any way (which is something that other users have reported), but we certainly have no complaints.\n\n Brave’s massive growth signals rising concerns over privacy online\n\nTaking a more scientific method, we ran three different tests on both browsers using the tools available at browserbench.org. The tests measure a mixture of JavaScript performance, graphics and the responsiveness of web applications. The results show that, in our case at least, Chrome scores slightly higher across the board in all three categories, but not by any huge margins. Raw numbers here mean very little when there’s no perceptible difference in speed during normal use, so don’t let that put you off.\n\nOne noticeable difference we did appreciate, was how much less resource-intensive Brave is compared to Chrome. Google’s browser is a notorious memory hog, and throughout our benchmark tests, Chrome was using between 150-400MB more RAM than Brave. This might not seem like much, but it can make a large impact depending on the hardware you’re using, so Brave’s lighter footprint is definitely very much appreciated.\n\nBRAVE BROWSER: FEATURES, SECURITY, AND PRIVACY \n\nBrave has a number of features that make it stand out from the crowd. Its biggest selling point for most users is its Shields feature, which automatically blocks all ads and trackers. You can click the small Brave logo icon at the end of the URL bar to see how many items are blocked on the page you’re on, and you can tweak the settings to make the blocking more or less aggressive, or turn it off entirely. The tool can also be used to block scripts, as well as upgrade connections to HTTPS for more security where possible. \n\nIf you want to take your private browsing one step further, you can also open the menu and select ‘New private window with Tor’. This will open up a private Tor tab, which offers far more privacy than regular incognito mode. \n\nRegular incognito mode prevents your browsing history, cookies, site data or information entered in forms from being stored on your device. Your browsing activity, however, can still be visible to, for example, your employer, school, or internet service provider (ISP).\n\nThe private Tor tab purportedly offers genuine anonymity, as it hides your IP address from the sites you visit by redirecting your browsing activities through several different servers before it reaches your destination. As these connections are encrypted, your ISP or employer can’t see what sites you’re visiting—but there is a downside. All that re-routing has a dramatic impact on speed.\n[Brave browser speed test]Brave's Tor browser is noticeably slower. Image: speedtest.net\nOur PC, for example, is hooked up to a router via ethernet for maximum stability and speed, and our regular download speeds measure around the 215-220 Mbps mark. In contrast, a private Tor tab measures drastically lower speeds, between 3-5 Mbps. Given that we personally don’t need the extreme anonymity offered by the Tor tab in our general browsing activities, this isn’t a dealbreaker by any means, and many people happily accept the tradeoff for the sake of total privacy.\n\nHowever, Brave's Tor integration has not been entirely bug-free. In February 2021, it was revealed that Brave had been leaking private .onion addresses to domain name service providers. Although the bug has since been patched, it does raise concerns over just how private Brave's private browsing features are. Indeed, in a 2019 Reddit AMA, Brave's VP of IT Ryan Watson conceded that \"Brave with Tor does not provide the same level of Privacy as the Tor browser, if your life depends on remaining anonymous, use the Tor browser.\"\n\nBRAVE BROWSER WALLET\n\nBefore we dive into how to actually earn crypto on Brave, it’s worth noting that it also has a built-in Ethereum crypto wallet with support for ETH and most standard Ethereum tokens and collectibles. The wallet allows you to store and send Ethereum tokens, and is similar in functionality to MetaMask, except it’s built into the browser itself.\n[Brave browser]Brave's Binance widget lets you buy and trade crypto in-browser. Image: Brave\nYou can also link your Binance account to a built-in widget that appears on the Brave home screen, allowing you to trade, buy, and deposit crypto directly. It’s a nice feature to have, but we’d still prefer to use Binance’s own site directly. Call us old-fashioned, but trading through a widget feels a little unnerving, though we’ll have to embrace the future eventually.\n\n Brave has recently announced that it's embracing the world of DeFi, and will be adding a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator to its offering, with discounts for those who hold and use BAT on the platform. But how do you get your hands on BAT? Read on…\n\nHOW TO EARN CRYPTO USING BRAVE \n\nBrave’s most famous feature is its built-in ad system that rewards you for viewing ads with BAT tokens, while also giving you the option to contribute your earned tokens to sites that accept BAT, to support them.\n\nClicking the triangular icon at the end of the URL bar shows your current BAT balance, as well as letting you know if a site has signed up to receive contributions from Brave users. If they have, then you have the option so send a tip, or set a monthly contribution.\n\nHit up the top right menu, select ‘Brave Rewards’, and you can tweak your experience. The settings on this screen let you turn rewards on or off, as well as tweak how many ads you’re shown every hour, up to a maximum of five.\n[Brave browser screenshot]You can earn BAT by browsing, and tip sites to show support. Image: Brave\nIf you keep using the browser, you’ll eventually receive your rewards on your next payment date, which is also listed. While you can earn and contribute with BAT without signing up for anything, you’ll need to carry out an extra step if you want to cash it out, or contribute to your wallet from other sources.\n\nBut if you want to cash in your BAT or contribute to your account with funds from other sources, you need to verify your wallet through Uphold, a highly rated digital currency broker. Uphold even offers a debit MasterCard that you can back with crypto.\n\n What is Basic Attention Token (BAT)?\n\nOnce you reach a minimum of 25 BAT in your account, you’ll be able to verify your wallet through Uphold. You’ll need to set your email and password, as well as provide your real name, birth date and phone number, as well as supply a photo of your face and ID. \n\nIt might sound alarming if you’re not used to it, but this form of identity protection is standard practice for crypto brokers, to help verify your identity. Note that Uphold isn’t currently licensed to operate in New York, though it’s working on getting approval.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that you’re not going to be rolling in money if you turn Brave Rewards on. In 2018, Brendan Eich told Hacker News that he “would not be surprised if our users can make $70/year as we bring the system up in 2019,” estimating that users would earn around $224 a year in 2020. \n\nIn a 2019 Reddit thread, users reported earning between 20-30 BAT a month; with BAT’s price around $0.30, users claimed average earnings of around $6-7 BAT per month. Following the recent crypto bull run, BAT prices have increased slightly, and currently sit at around $0.50.\n\nBRAVE MOBILE \n\n [Brave browser running on a smartphone]Brave is also available for Android and iOS devices. Image: Decrypt\nIf you want to maximize your Brave rewards, or simply enjoy the same ad-free, privacy-focused experience while you’re on the move, then you’ll be pleased to hear that you can get close to the complete Brave experience on both iPhone and Android.\n\nBrave’s mobile app is just as fast and slick as the desktop version, and the Shields, ad-blocking and rewards all work the same, regardless of whether you link the mobile browser to your desktop app. The only hitch we came across was the fact that the wallet and Brave rewards were both missing from our Huawei handset, although we’re putting that down to the lack of Google’s services on Huawei handsets. Other Android devices posed no such problems.\n\nPrivacy fiends may also want to download the Tor app separately, as the mobile version of Brave has yet to support Tor private tabs.\n\nBRAVE TODAY\n\nAs of December 2020, Brave includes the Brave Today news feed on the start page for iOS and desktop devices (Android owners are, sadly, out of luck for the time being).\n\nThe \"privacy-preserving content stream\" uses Brave's own private content delivery network (CDN) to populate its feed. It's populated locally, based on an algorithm that selects content based on how new it is, and the user's browsing history—but, crucially, no-one, even Brave, can track what you're reading.\n[Brave Today]Brave Today is a privacy-preserving news feed. Image: Decrypt\nIn practice, it's simple to use; just scroll down from the start page to view the latest stories. Once you've viewing the news feed, a \"Customize\" button will pop up in the lower right corner of the screen; click on this to pick and choose from a selection of sources across 15 different categories, including Travel, Entertainment, Fashion and Science (you'll find _Decrypt_ listed under Crypto, gentle readers…).\n\nDesign-wise it's a bit of a mixed bag; there's a decent selection of stories from across your chosen sources, presented in an aesthetically-pleasing layout, with tiles containing individual stories interspersed with lists from single news sources, and \"bundled\" categories. Some of the hero images are awkwardly cropped, which strips a bit of the visual polish off the layout; Brave could do with taking a leaf out of Twitter's book and using a smart auto-cropping algorithm, but it's not a deal-breaker.\n\nIPFS SUPPORT\n\nIn January 2021, Brave announced built-in support for InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)—making it the first web browser in the world to do so. In essence, IPFS is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol which allows users to browse the Internet in a different way to standard HTTP.\n\nWhen we use HTTP or HTTPS, our browsers use URLs to access sites that are based on centralized servers. This means that your distance to these servers affects how long it takes to load a page, and their centralized nature puts control of the information in other peoples’ hands. The fact that certain governments can easily block access to certain sites and information is an example of one of the main problems with the standard HTTP/S route.\n\nIPFS, on the other hand, distributes site data across a network, in a similar vein to things like BitTorrent and blockchain, accessing content through URIs (Universal Resource Indicators) instead of URLs. In this instance, your device acts as a node that stores website data.\n\nWhen you load up an IPFS website then, you’re actually loading it up from other nodes on the network. Not only does this result in faster loading times and streaming speeds, but it’ll also mean that websites won’t go offline for everyone if a single server goes offline. Crucially, it also gives power back to the people, preventing censorship.\n\nDecrypt Diaries: Why We Built on IPFS\nThere are a few options available if you want to load IPFS content through Brave. You can choose to act as a node yourself, which gives you a unique hashed ID and allows you to contribute to loading site data for other users. Alternatively, you can instead access IPFS sites via a public gateway, though these will log your IP address.\n\nIf you’ve got Brave 1.19 or higher, you can go to Settings \u003e Extensions, and select how you’d like to access IPFS content. Given that the protocol is still in its infancy compared to the long-established HTTP, there aren’t a huge number of IPFS sites to explore—but _Decrypt _is one of them; click on the \"IPFS\" button at the bottom of any article (including this one) to view the IPFS version of the page.\n\nIf you'd like to look farther afield, Brave has supplied its own example IPFS page, and you can find more online to test out yourselves.\n\nWe can’t actually hyperlink their example as it’s not recognized as a URL, which just goes to show you how early things are, so feel free to copy and paste this the old fashioned way:\n\nipfs://bafybeiemxf5abjwjbikoz4mc3a3dla6ual3jsgpdr4cjr3oz3evfyavhwq/wiki/Vincent_van_Gogh.html\n\nVERDICT \n\nWe’ll cut to the chase—we’re fully converted to Brave, and it’s now our default browser across desktop and mobile. \n\nIf you’re a Chrome user, then the switch is a no-brainer, as you’re getting the same experience in a browser that not only uses up fewer system resources, but also blocks ads, pays you to view non-tracking ads, and offers a bunch of easy to use, powerful privacy features in the process.\n\nWhy 2020 is the year of privacy\nWith so many people using Chrome already across their devices, we have no qualms recommending Brave to even technophobic family and friends. \n\nIn a world where it seems that everything we do is being scrutinized online, Brave is a super simple way to take some power back, while being rewarded in the process—and the ability to support content creators yourself is an added bonus.\n","read_this_next_post_id":4013,"read_this_next_post_type":"post","social_share_img_url":"https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brave-browser-review-main-gID_7.jpg","featured_image_caption":"Brave Browser is available for desktop and mobile.

Here's everything you want to know about  how the tokens are created, how they work, what they can be used for, and why Decrypt created its own reader token. \n\nWHAT IS THE DECRYPT TOKEN?\n\nThe Decrypt Reader Token is used to reward our most loyal and active readers.\n\nIt’s backed against real cryptocurrency and sent in lightning-fast microtransactions as you read. The token lives inside the Decrypt app, which is available on iOS and Android. \n\nCurrently, the tokens cannot be exchanged for other tokens, or exchanged for fiat. \n\nHOW DO I EARN TOKENS?\n\nEarning tokens couldn’t be simpler. Download our app and create a wallet—it literally takes a few seconds. From that point on, as long as you’re logged into your wallet and are in the app, you automatically earn tokens as you read. You can boost your earnings by sharing and reacting to articles. \n[Decrypt Reward Token Drop]\n\nNew tokens are released in “seasons.” You can see how many are up for grabs at any time in the wallet menu.\n\nWHAT IS A SEASON?\n\nWe partner with great companies to release new batches of tokens into the community. We call this a “season.”\n\nWe think this is a great way for companies to become an immersive part of the token experience while keeping things exciting for our users.\n\nIn each season there are a limited number of tokens up for grabs, so be quick!\n\nWHAT CAN I DO WITH THE DECRYPT TOKEN?\n\nThe Decrypt token can be used to redeem rewards on the Decrypt reward store. You can find the reward store inside the app. \n\nDuring our first season, users who've amassed enough tokens can swap them for super limited NFTs created by some of our favorite artists. But we plan on offering a lot more than that as our token evolves. Each season will feature something new so keep checking in to see what’s on offer. \n\n[Decrypt Token daily cap UI]\n\nTo redeem your tokens click on the “Rewards” button on the wallet menu.\n\nIn the future, Decrypt drops will evolve to include a host of different rewards and different functionality. So stay tuned. \n\nWHY IS DECRYPT INTRODUCING A TOKEN?\n\nAt Decrypt we’ve always been firm believers that the technology we write about every day should be a core part of our DNA.\n\nWe believe that applying Web3 technology in thoughtful and engaging ways can help us tell better stories and also be a step toward solving some of media’s biggest problems. \n\n The reader token is a natural progression of our mission to demystify the decentralized web. With our token we can now introduce those readers to the core concepts of cryptocurrencies: wallets, balances, transactions. \n\nWe believe there is a better way for media companies to bring together audiences, publishers, and advertisers in a way where everyone can benefit. The Decrypt Reader Token is the first step in that journey. \n\nWHAT PROBLEM DOES THE DECRYPT TOKEN SOLVE? \n\nWe believe it's essential for the media industry to create better relationships between readers and advertisers. Tokens can help unlock new and better ways for media companies to thrive.\n\nTwo of the leading reasons users want a connection to a brand is a sense of ownership and the opportunity for rewards.\n\nWe like to think of the Decrypt Reader Token as a tool to build a more engaged community of readers.\n\nHOW DOES ALL THIS WORK?\n\nThe Decrypt Reader Token is built on OpenST, an open-source token platform. This allows us to ensure that the wallet is totally non-custodial. That means you have full ownership and control over your tokens. All keys are stored on your mobile device. Decrypt can’t see or control that password. \n\nAll the transactions that happen in the background while you read take place on Ethereum, the leading platform for blockchain applications. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Lqeb6g15k\n\nWhen you complete an earn action, we transfer tokens from the Decrypt reserve to your wallet. We do this through an \"Ethereum sidechain\" to achieve fast and extremely low-cost microtransactions.\n\nAt the moment, the tokens cannot be exchanged for other tokens, or exchanged for fiat. \n\nTHE FUTURE \n\nOur initial implementation of the Decrypt Reader Token is designed to be simple, fun, and engaging. We have lots of plans to make the token more useful to our community of users, while helping Decrypt to improve and support its journalism.\n\nWe have a Discord channel we use to keep people updated on what’s happening with the Decrypt Reader Token.

technology provides a beneficial layer of openness and transparency that current centralized networks cannot, but some private data isn’t meant to be shared publicly. \n\nHow many people want to use a network that shares their financial details and identifying information to everyone, for example?\n\nThat’s the issue that Secret Network aims to solve. By enabling programmable smart contracts that run on blockchain and compute within trusted execution environments, shielding the data from the nodes themselves, Secret Network promises the transparent benefits of blockchain with the kind of security and privacy that users demand from web services.\n\nHere’s a look at how Secret Network works and what the community behind it hopes to achieve with the project.\n\nWHAT IS SECRET NETWORK?\n\nSecret Network is a blockchain built specifically for data privacy. By supporting encrypted inputs, outputs, and smart contract states, Secret Network enables programmable smart contracts that keep user data safe. If coins like Monero and Zcash are the privacy-centric evolution of Bitcoin, Secret Network’s smart contracts are like an evolution of Ethereum’s own smart contracts, building upon that premise while enabling the secure transfer of private data.\n\nSecret Network was born out of Enigma, a startup that developed the concept of a decentralized protocol for secret smart contracts. Enigma raised $45 million in a 2017 initial coin offering (ICO), but faced enforcement from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in 2020 that forced a settlement with the SEC.\n\nUltimately, the community around Enigma decided to continue that vision as an independent, decentralized project, which is how the current version of Secret Network was born. A swap allowed holders of Enigma’s Ethereum-based ENG token to trade 1:1 for SCRT, the native coin of Secret Network used for governance and paying fees. Enigma remains involved as one of the key players in the community supporting development of Secret Network.\n\nHOW DOES SECRET NETWORK WORK?\n\nSecret Network is a layer-1 blockchain with its own consensus and on-chain governance, built atop the Cosmos/Tendermint framework. It relies on a network of distributed nodes that perform the computation of smart contracts built on Secret Network, but the nodes use a trusted execution environment (TEE)—like a black box—to do so away from prying eyes.\n\nIt’s similar to how a smartphone processor uses a TEE to handle sensitive data like fingerprints, but it’s a blockchain node instead. The network bills its smart contracts as “secret contracts,” as they’re designed to preserve the privacy of the data held within. The SCRT (“Secret”) coin must be staked by nodes to participate in the network, plus it is used to pay fees and transfer value.\n\n As part of the 2020 settlement, the SEC forced Enigma to offer refunds to investors, register its token as a security, and pay a $500,000 fine.\n\nWHAT’S SO SPECIAL ABOUT SECRET NETWORK?\n\nThere’s a lot to like about blockchains as far as being immutable and transparent, but that kind of openness limits the kind of data that can be safely handled by many blockchains—particularly top-secret data that people or companies wouldn’t want seen by just anyone. \n\nSecret Network aims to plug that hole by providing the layer of privacy and security while still keeping what people like about blockchain technology—the best of both worlds, in theory. While it’s not the only company attempting to fill that void, it’s a concept that could be key to driving the future of certain decentralized apps (dapps), particularly in the realm of decentralized finance (DeFi).\n\nWHAT CAN YOU DO WITH SECRET NETWORK?\n\nSecret Network is designed to empower decentralized applications that demand a level of privacy not found on many other blockchain networks. By using a trusted execution environment and keeping private data away from both the public and node operators, it can handle sensitive information that users and organizations might not otherwise be willing to share.\n\nThe network’s operators have proposed a wide number of potential use cases, including credit scoring and lending dapps that ensure privacy, machine learning capabilities that still retain privacy in the process, and improving the ability to safely share and monetize data. More widely, Secret Network could potentially be useful to any dapp that handles sensitive data.\n\n Cosmos, the framework Secret Network is built on, is billed as “the internet of blockchains” and aims to create an interconnected ecosystem of blockchains, whereas many current blockchains are like individual silos.\n\n\u003e NEW Update! 🚨$SEFI, native governance token for Secret DeFi, now has a genesis date: March 31st, 2021.\n\u003e \n\u003e In this blog: how you can receive $SEFI, recent @secret_swap growth and improvements, upcoming bridges (including #BSC and beyond), and more!$SCRThttps://t.co/GCxGf8T30B\n\u003e \n\u003e — 𝕊ecret Network (@SecretNetwork) March 17, 2021\n\nTHE FUTURE FOR SCRT\n\nWith the ENG-to-SCRT token swap concluding in January 2021, effectively closing the book on the old Enigma project, Secret Network is trying to build towards a future that embraces interoperability with other blockchains. A lack of cross-chain compatibility could limit Secret Network’s appeal and ultimately keep it from being as widespread or useful as the community developers intend it to be.\n\nSecret Network is also making a big decentralized finance push with its Secret DeFi initiative, and launched a SecretSwap decentralized exchange in February 2021. According to the Secret Network FAQ, “part of our vision has always been bringing privacy to _every_ blockchain,” and it calls out Cosmos inter-blockchain communication and interoperability as another potential initiative on the roadmap.\n\nBeyond that, Secret Network appears focused on attracting more developers to build their dapps on the blockchain, thus demonstrating more use cases in the process.

This means you can keep them in your digital wallet and send them to other people, or sell them in online marketplaces.\n\nEach Top Shot features a moment from basketball history, in the form of a short video clip.\n\n\u003e Metallic Gold LE Challenge 19 expires in 24 hours ⏰\n\u003e \n\u003e Collectors have until Friday, March 19 at 10am PDT to acquire all 9️⃣ required Moments to score this exclusive reward of Terry Rozier throwing down a vicious 🔨 over KD 😤\n\u003e \n\u003e More info: https://t.co/Rkg3ro7D3t pic.twitter.com/m3Db0aWGKK\n\u003e \n\u003e — NBA Top Shot (@nbatopshot) March 18, 2021\n\nSimilar to trading cards, there are multiple cards for each moment. Packs are released in various sizes, with smaller packs increasing the rarity of the cards. The common tier includes packs that have 10,000 cards or more. The rare tier has packs of 150-4,999 cards and the legendary tier limits them to 25-499 cards.\n\nWithin each pack, each card has its own serial number. But these can cause prices to vary wildly. For example, for a Jayson Tatum jump shot, the lowest ask is $52; the highest sale, for serial #5206, $28,000. That’s a huge discrepancy for the same card—something to bear in mind if you’re looking to resell the cards.\n[Jayson Tatum shooting hoops]A Jayson Tatum assist. Image: NBA Top Shot.\nThere are multiple trading sets too. The “For The Win” series comprises 10 specific moments from one of Spencer Dinwiddie’s jump shots to a Nemanja Bjelica three-pointer. They are all rare cards.\n\nCREATING AN ACCOUNT WITH DAPPER LABS\n\nUnlike traditional trading cards, these collectibles aren’t printed out on paper and sold in physical stores. Rather, NBA Top Shot cards are stored on the Flow blockchain, which was built by Dapper Labs (the team behind early NFT phenomenon CryptoKitties). So they’re a little bit more complicated to get hold of.\n\nTo get started, you’ll need to register for NBA Top Shot with Dapper. You can do this by clicking sign up on the Top Shot website. Creating a Dapper account gives you a wallet that stores funds and enables you to purchase crypto collectibles.\n[Signing up for Dapper]How to sign up for Dapper. Image: Dapper Labs.\nRegistering with Dapper is straightforward. You sign in via Google or email, then provide your telephone number and verify it. Dapper then provides you with a code that you need to keep safely in case you lose access via the device you’re on. It’s important to write this down somewhere and keep it in a safe place, as it controls access to your account.\n\nGETTING STARTED WITH NBA TOP SHOT\n\nOnce you’ve registered with Dapper, you can go straight to NBA Top Shot and use the account to sign in.\n\nThe first time you sign in, you’ll be greeted with a couple of introductory videos, before you’re asked if you want to join the NBA Top Shot Discord channel. Then you’ll be able to select which team you support.\n[Choosing your basketball team]You can choose your favorite team. Image: NBA Top Shot.\nOnce you’re in, you will see your randomly generated username. You can easily change this by clicking “change username,” going to your Dapper Labs profile and choosing something that suits you better.\n\nNow you can explore the packs on offer (which will typically be sold out!) and the marketplace where you can buy trading cards second hand. But in order to buy anything, you’ll need some funds.\n\nLOADING UP YOUR ACCOUNT\n\nIn order to buy an NBA Top Shot moment, you’ll need to put some funds into your Dapper account.\n\nYou can do this by going to “Payment and Payouts” on the site. Here, you choose how much you want to put into your account; you’ll have to agree to Dapper’s terms and conditions. Then you can either pay with a credit card, by entering your details, or with cryptocurrency. Dapper accepts Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and two stablecoins: DAI and USDC.\n[Adding money to your account]How to add funds to your Dapper account. Image: Dapper Labs.\nOnce you’ve loaded up your account with funds, you may need to wait for them to land in your wallet (cryptocurrencies can sometimes be a bit slow) before they’re ready to spend. You will also have to pay network fees when making a cryptocurrency transaction, so make sure to check how much that will cost and account for it (Bitcoin fees are currently around $13 per transaction).\n\nUSING THE NBA TOP SHOT MARKETPLACE\n\nThe marketplace can be a bit overwhelming, because there are thousands of Top Shot cards—but there are ways to narrow down the list. You can select moments for specific teams or players, and you can rank the cards by price.\n\nIf you want to purchase a card, you will need to find the moment you like and select the serial number of the specific card. Then you click purchase and you can pay with the funds in your Dapper account.\n\nAfter that, what can you do with them? Well, you can store the cards and watch the moments when you want. You can then put them up for sale, or, if you’re generous enough, you can gift them to a friend. What you _can’t _do is use the footage in the Top Shot yourself, or modify the image without permission—in fact, the NBA’s lawyers have put together a laundry list of prohibitions restricting what you can do with their costly IP.\n","read_this_next_post_id":61565,"read_this_next_post_type":"post","social_share_img_url":"https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nba-top-shot-basketball-gID_5-pID_5.png","featured_image_caption":"NBA Top Shot.

CryptoKitties, one of the very first non-fungible token (NFT) projects,  brought the Ethereum blockchain to a halt in late 2017 due to immense congestion, developer Dapper Labs learned firsthand that current-gen blockchains weren’t built to handle such demand.\n\nRather than simply find another home for the decentralized app (dapp) or wait for Ethereum scaling solutions to mature, Dapper decided to build the kind of blockchain that it and other developers could rely on.\n\nThe result is Flow, a blockchain purpose-built to support things like NFT collectibles and large-scale crypto games.\n\n\u003e On @flow_blockchain, CryptoKitties will demo the full power of composability, on-chain storage, and crypto for consumer apps – we can add new features, genes, breeding components, and extensibility for third party developers without affecting the core trust of the collector pic.twitter.com/Yohu0dTi8q\n\u003e \n\u003e — Roham (@rohamg) January 26, 2021\n\nCryptoKitties will soon migrate to Flow, and with the surging success of Dapper’s NBA Top Shot, and many other developers signing on to build with Flow amidst the NFT boom, it could prove to be one of the leading blockchains for such creations.\n\nHere’s a look at what Flow is, how it works, and how to get ahold of the FLOW token.\n\nWHAT IS FLOW?\n\nFlow is a blockchain that is designed for extensive scaling without the use of sharding techniques, providing fast and low-cost transactions that make sense for dapps such as NFT marketplaces and crypto-infused video games.\n\nAs mentioned, Flow hails from Dapper Labs, which decided to solve its blockchain congestion problem head-on by building one primed for games and other interactive experiences. Dapper is now using Flow for all of its own projects, including NBA Top Shot, but it’s open to other developers as well.\n\n\u003e Flow is split into FOUR node types to achieve dramatic improvements in speed and throughput\n\u003e \n\u003e 1️⃣ Collector Nodes increase efficiency\n\u003e 2️⃣ Execution Nodes enable speed and scale\n\u003e 3️⃣ Verifier Nodes guarantee correctness\n\u003e 4️⃣ Consensus Nodes ensure decentralizationhttps://t.co/8zFlufRONm pic.twitter.com/7FJoEKSi7K\n\u003e \n\u003e — Flow Blockchain (@flow_blockchain) December 6, 2020\n\nHOW DOES FLOW WORK?\n\nFlow uses a proof-of-stake model that requires validators to stake a certain number of FLOW tokens to participate in the network.\n\nHowever, the way that validation works is unique amongst blockchains as Flow splits validation tasks into four separate types of nodes: consensus, verification, execution, and collection. All four node types participate in the validation of each transaction.\n\nDapper says that splitting up the tasks makes processing transactions more efficient than on rival blockchains. It’s an alternative option to sharding, or spreading out the storage and computational needs of a blockchain across numerous nodes. Flow does not use sharding, and by doing so, Dapper says that Flow keeps transactions atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID), and allows developers to build on each others’ work.\n\nFlow also features upgradeable smart contracts, allowing smart contracts to be deployed in beta and then enhanced or fixed before being finalized and made immutable.\n\nCryptoKitties will migrate from Ethereum to Flow, with Dapper promising new features for the breedable digital cats as well as use in future games running on Flow. \n\nWHAT’S SO SPECIAL ABOUT FLOW?\n\nFlow is built for the kind of collectible and interactive crypto experiences that are quickly growing in prominence, and could find much larger audiences in the years to come. NBA Top Shot has already demonstrated the potential for a blockchain-driven collectibles experience to generate huge sums of cash and find major mainstream attention. That’s just one experience built on top of Flow, with many more to come.\n\n\u003e Remember this dunk? 😳\n\u003e \n\u003e This Moment is the exclusive reward for the Rising Stars Challenge 1, which ends Tuesday, March 30 at 10am PT ⏰\n\u003e \n\u003e Collect all 9️⃣ required Moments \u0026 score yourself this monster of a poster Moment from Anthony Edwards🔨\n\u003e \n\u003e More info: https://t.co/Rkg3ropdV1 pic.twitter.com/HDIQdT7KN7\n\u003e \n\u003e — NBA Top Shot (@nbatopshot) March 10, 2021\n\nFLOW + NBA + UFC\n\nNBA Top Shot has already been an enormous success, but Dapper Labs has other high-profile partners in its stable. The firm has signed deals with Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and Dr. Suess to develop crypto collectibles experiences along the same lines. Besides those brands, Dapper also has partners like gadget giant Samsung, game publisher Ubisoft, and Warner Music Group.\n\nWHAT CAN YOU DO WITH FLOW?\n\nRight now, as a user, you can interact with Flow via NBA Top Shot or by buying artwork from the VIV3 NFT marketplace, as well as other working apps built on the blockchain. Developers can begin using the various built-in tools to experiment with Flow and start building their own dapps.\n\nDapper Labs raised a $12 million investment round in August 2020 that featured participation from several current NBA players, including Andre Iguodala and Spencer Dinwiddie. \n\nWHERE TO BUY FLOW\n\nFlow’s native FLOW token was initially offered to the public in October 2020 through CoinList, but was unavailable within the United States and Canada. Tokens sold through the offering were locked up for at least a year thereafter, which means they can’t be circulated until they're unlocked.\n\nOn the other hand, FLOW rewards paid to validators can be transferred and sold, so there is some FLOW out on the market, and some exchanges—like Kraken and Huobi—let users transact FLOW. However, major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase do not currently handle FLOW.\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\nNFT collectibles blew up in a big way in late 2020 and early 2021, and Flow has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of that surge. Not only has Dapper Labs’ own NBA Top Shot been one of the most successful crypto dapps, but Flow has reported a significant uptick in developer requests during the early weeks of 2021. In short, NBA Top Shot has been a successful proof of concept for Dapper’s custom-built blockchain, and now other developers want to tap into that infrastructure.\n\n\u003e 🌊Flow developer ecosystem update🌊\n\u003e \n\u003e Since we shared our last update a week ago, 100+ more developers and teams have started building on Flow, resulting in a 20%+ week-over-week growth\n\u003e \n\u003e Don’t wait on the sideline, it's time to build#BuildOnFlowhttps://t.co/VahEt6nKh6 pic.twitter.com/kEyMUZRJhT\n\u003e \n\u003e — Flow Blockchain (@flow_blockchain) March 8, 2021\n\nDapper has its own additional collectibles platforms in the works, too. Flow is designed to be used for more elaborate game experiences, as well: Dapper calls it the “blockchain for open worlds.” On one hand, “open” implies decentralization—but it may only be a matter of time before it plays host to large-scale crypto games, as well.\n","read_this_next_post_id":5692,"read_this_next_post_type":"post","social_share_img_url":"https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Flow-gID_6-pID_6.png","featured_image_caption":"Flow blockchain.

The gaming giant, which has dozens of international studios, first signaled its interest in blockchain technology by unveiling a proof-of-concept \u003ca href=\"https://decrypt.co/4915/hashcraft-ubisoft-blockchain-future-of-gaming\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003eprototype called HashCraft\u003c/a\u003e, a crypto-infused riff on Minecraft, in 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"ad-unit\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUbisoft has since continued on in the space by working closely with crypto gaming startups and releasing its own small-scale experiments. The publisher’s blockchain ambitions come from its Strategic Innovation Lab, which is headed up by Nicolas Pouard, Blockchain Initiative Director. “It’s a think tank and a ‘do’ tank, as we like to put it,” Pouard told \u003ci\u003eDecrypt\u003c/i\u003e during a recent phone interview. “Our mission is to anticipate the future and help Ubisoft to be prepared for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"embedded-post\" data-id=59956 data-post-title=\"Ubisoft Gets Behind a New Free-to-Play Crypto Game\" data-post-type=\"post\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://wp.decrypt.co/59956/ubisoft-sorare-free-crypto-game-one-shot-league/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003eUbisoft Gets Behind a New Free-to-Play Crypto Game\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil recently, Ubisoft’s moves in the space have erred more on the side of “thinking” than “doing,” primarily providing support to blockchain game developers and other crypto projects. But with the \u003ca href=\"https://decrypt.co/59956/ubisoft-sorare-free-crypto-game-one-shot-league\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003erecent release of One Shot League\u003c/a\u003e, a free-to-play fantasy soccer game created in collaboration with Sorare, we’re starting to see the firm put more of those ambitions into action. Given Ubisoft’s stature in the game industry, it could prove to be a leading force in blockchain adoption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTaking their Shot\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn one hand, One Shot League looks like an attempt to create an accessible on-ramp to Sorare and to the idea of crypto gaming as a whole. The free-to-play game, which is in the midst of its initial five-week beta season, requires a Sorare account. However, it does not force players to buy cards or handle cryptocurrencies. Tied into the last few weeks of the current Belgian Jupiler Pro League season, the game provides free digital cards for users to arrange into fantasy lineups to try and earn the most points on the in-game leaderboard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"\u003e\n\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003eDiscover an all-new fantasy football experience with One Shot League!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeveloped by the Ubisoft Strategic Innovation Lab, build your squad for the Belgian Pro League and win digital collectible \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/SorareHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003e@SorareHQ\u003c/a\u003e cards ⚽ \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFT?src=hash\u0026amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003e#NFT\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026mdash; Ubisoft (@Ubisoft) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/1366740702772789249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003eMarch 2, 2021\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, there are benefits to using purchased Sorare cards in the form of performance boosts. For existing Sorare players, it’s another way to make the most of their investment. Perhaps more importantly, for newcomers, One Shot League can be a bridge into crypto gaming—with the lure of added benefits and ongoing participation luring them into the real-deal Sorare experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile officially a collaboration between Ubisoft and Sorare, the Ubisoft Strategic Lab is actually the developer behind One Shot League. It is not branded primarily as a Sorare product, but rather a separate experience that makes use of Sorare’s assets. According to Pouard, that was one of the big lures from their end: the prospect of interoperability between games that can seamlessly share the same crypto assets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s one of the big, key hooks that blockchain gaming has to offer over traditional game experiences.

blockchain gaming world is largely populated by startups built specifically to pioneer the burgeoning industry of crypto games, whether it’s Immutable with card-battler Gods Unchained, Sorare with its popular fantasy soccer platform, or Sky Mavis behind the Pokémon-inspired Axie Infinity.\n\nHowever, there is one very big exception: Ubisoft, one of the largest traditional game publishers in the world, and the storied brand behind mega-franchises like Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, Just Dance, and various Tom Clancy-branded shooters. The gaming giant, which has dozens of international studios, first signaled its interest in blockchain technology by unveiling a proof-of-concept prototype called HashCraft, a crypto-infused riff on Minecraft, in 2019.\n\nUbisoft has since continued on in the space by working closely with crypto gaming startups and releasing its own small-scale experiments. The publisher’s blockchain ambitions come from its Strategic Innovation Lab, which is headed up by Nicolas Pouard, Blockchain Initiative Director. “It’s a think tank and a ‘do’ tank, as we like to put it,” Pouard told _Decrypt_ during a recent phone interview. “Our mission is to anticipate the future and help Ubisoft to be prepared for it.”\n\nUbisoft Gets Behind a New Free-to-Play Crypto Game\nUntil recently, Ubisoft’s moves in the space have erred more on the side of “thinking” than “doing,” primarily providing support to blockchain game developers and other crypto projects. But with the recent release of One Shot League, a free-to-play fantasy soccer game created in collaboration with Sorare, we’re starting to see the firm put more of those ambitions into action. Given Ubisoft’s stature in the game industry, it could prove to be a leading force in blockchain adoption.\n\nTAKING THEIR SHOT\n\nOn one hand, One Shot League looks like an attempt to create an accessible on-ramp to Sorare and to the idea of crypto gaming as a whole. The free-to-play game, which is in the midst of its initial five-week beta season, requires a Sorare account. However, it does not force players to buy cards or handle cryptocurrencies. Tied into the last few weeks of the current Belgian Jupiler Pro League season, the game provides free digital cards for users to arrange into fantasy lineups to try and earn the most points on the in-game leaderboard.\n\n\u003e Discover an all-new fantasy football experience with One Shot League!\n\u003e \n\u003e Developed by the Ubisoft Strategic Innovation Lab, build your squad for the Belgian Pro League and win digital collectible @SorareHQ cards ⚽ #NFT\n\u003e \n\u003e — Ubisoft (@Ubisoft) March 2, 2021\n\nHowever, there are benefits to using purchased Sorare cards in the form of performance boosts. For existing Sorare players, it’s another way to make the most of their investment. Perhaps more importantly, for newcomers, One Shot League can be a bridge into crypto gaming—with the lure of added benefits and ongoing participation luring them into the real-deal Sorare experience.\n\nWhile officially a collaboration between Ubisoft and Sorare, the Ubisoft Strategic Lab is actually the developer behind One Shot League. It is not branded primarily as a Sorare product, but rather a separate experience that makes use of Sorare’s assets. According to Pouard, that was one of the big lures from their end: the prospect of interoperability between games that can seamlessly share the same crypto assets.\n\nIt’s one of the big, key hooks that blockchain gaming has to offer over traditional game experiences. Crypto gaming firm Enjin, for example, has made interchangeable Ethereum “multiverse” assets a key pillar of its development platform, and has even developed a server plug-in for Minecraft that lets users bring cryptoassets into the game. Pouard pointed to a collaboration between CryptoKitties and Gods Unchained in 2019, and said that kind of idea is something they wanted to explore further with One Shot League.\n[Nicolas Pouard]Nicolas Pouard, Blockchain Innovation Director at Ubisoft. Image: Ubisoft\n“Since then, we didn’t really see experiments giving a real chance of building a true side game around blockchain assets built by another company. That’s what we wanted to explore: how we could change the gamers’ behavior using these assets, and how it could change the value of these assets,” he said. “How do you expand and extend the ecosystem of a game starting with the assets themselves? That was the occasion.”\n\nOne Shot League will hold another short beta season to cover the Jupiler Pro League playoffs, and then the collaborators will take the summer thereafter to evaluate the data and decide whether or not to continue on with the game. It has the potential to broaden exposure to NFTs and their applications in gaming even beyond the recent NFT boom, but there’s no promise at this point that the game will continue on past these initial beta seasons.\n\n\"One Shot League is a way for us to help mainstream players to get a better understanding of what NFTs are.\"\n“One Shot League is a way for us to help mainstream players to get a better understanding of what NFTs are, and how you can enter this huge field of opportunity that NFTs are,” said Pouard. “We will see if it works or not, to be honest.”\n\nSTAYING BUSY IN THE LAB\n\nUbisoft and Sorare have been linked for some time now through the publisher’s Entrepreneurs Lab accelerator program, which invites startups in for guidance and collaboration. The program has worked with numerous crypto startups across several seasons, including the teams behind such games as Nine Chronicles, Splinterlands, and Axie Infinity.\n\nGaming titan Ubisoft inks deal with blockchain RPG Nine Chronicles\nSorare joined in the program’s fourth season back in October 2019, and soon thereafter rose to become one of the most prominent crypto games around. The fantasy platform has more than 125 licensed teams from around the globe, including Juventus FC, Real Madrid, and all of the Major League Soccer (MLS) squads, and saw its trading volume massively increase over the course of 2020. Its licensed player cards have also benefited from the NFT boom, and just before the announcement of One Shot League, Sorare announced a $50 million Series A funding round to join the $4 million seed round raised in July 2020.\n\n“It’s never obvious that a company will meet success, but here, they had all the ingredients actually. A football or soccer card game is one of the simplest ways to aggregate all the value that an NFT can bring,” said Pouard. “You have the players’ renown, of course. You have the scarcity. And you have the fantasy itself as a football or soccer fan. You need this kind of substrate to let your imagination grow and build your own fantasy. There were a lot of good ingredients. The team is something that impressed a lot of people within Ubisoft when we worked with them in the startup program… and they have a really good sense of timing.”\n\nThe Entrepreneurs Lab program allows Ubisoft exposure to an array of crypto startups that can potentially be collaborators down the line, and certainly the publisher’s ample resources and vast accumulated knowledge are valuable to startups looking to reach plenty of players.\n\nUbisoft’s first published crypto game, Rabbids Token, came from a collaboration with another Entrepreneurs Lab alum, South African startup Wildcards. That game, launched in June 2020, riffed on the Ethereum network-clogging CryptoKitties collectibles experience by letting people buy ERC-721 NFTs inspired by the popular Rayman Raving Rabbids franchise. There’s a twist, however: the owner must pay a recurring tax in ETH to hold onto the NFT, otherwise it can be snapped up by someone else without netting you any money in the process.\n[Rabbids Token screenshot]Rabbids Token was Ubisoft's first published crypto game. Image: Ubisoft\nThat might seem particularly punishing, but here’s the benefit: all of the money goes to charity UNICEF, plus if you did own the NFT, you’ll get a “Proof of Plausible Ownership” to add to your collection. According to the website, the project has raised 38.2 ETH (over $68,000) to date for UNICEF. It’s an oddball premise for any game experience, but especially one featuring the characters and the weighty branding of Ubisoft.\n\n“We were ending a project and we wanted to do something crazy, something different, and we really wanted to create our own NFTs and see how far we could go in the programmable aspect of things,” Pouard explained. “We saw in the token the opportunity to build an ever-going donation, and so first it was a side project—and really, the idea was not to build a real collectable game, but to see how far we could go in creating a new version of ERC-721.”\n\nTHE CRYPTO GAMING OUTLOOK\n\nAlong with publishing One Shot League and Rabbids Token, Ubisoft has also formalized its relationships with some of the aforementioned crypto game developers. The publisher is validating transactions for Axie Infinity, as well as EOS-based game store Ultra, and joined with startup accelerator Hashed on an advisory partnership for Nine Chronicles. Ubisoft also advises on Flow, the blockchain behind the surging NBA Top Shot.\n\nAsked about some of the current crypto games that excite him personally, Pouard pointed to the play-to-earn model of Axie Infinity that has thus far produced skyrocketing NFT sales, as well as the collectible experience of Top Shot, and the potential Roblox-esque game-as-a-platform appeal of creation game The Sandbox. “As we are still at the beginning of this whole blockchain gaming thing,” he explained, “every project is trying to pave the way for their vision of what blockchain gaming could be.”\n\nPouard believes that the current NFT explosion could be very beneficial for helping introduce crypto gaming into the mainstream, but worries that skyrocketing item costs will impact the ability for such games to pull in users.\n\n“[The NFT boom] helps with raising attention on blockchain gaming. My fear is that maybe all of the excitement leads to very high item values, and maybe it’s not a good thing for blockchain gaming,” he said. “It’s very difficult to predict the future, but for now, we can see that it helps great teams to earn money and build their games, so that’s great. It raises attention from the mainstream, so that’s helpful. But we need to be very careful on the monetization side. That’s why we wanted to build a free-to-play game with One Shot League.”\n\n\"[The NFT boom] helps with raising attention on blockchain gaming.\"\nWhat are Ubisoft’s next moves in the blockchain space? Unfortunately for some whose eyes widened at the original reveal, there are no current plans to release HashCraft to the public. It is no longer in active development, but even so, its creation helped spur Ubisoft's blockchain ambitions and even influenced other creators in the space, said Pouard.\n\n“We were very happy to see how it was inspiring for a lot of people. We discussed a lot with The Sandbox, for instance. They shared that for them, it helped them shape what The Sandbox could become, especially in the voxel part,” he said. “It was a proof of concept for us, a good prototype, and it was very inspiring also within Ubisoft.”\n[Ubisoft Entrepreneurs Lab]Ubisoft's Entrepreneurs Lab. Image: Ubisoft\nBut the Ubisoft stable has a lot of distinctive and very popular properties within it, like the aforementioned Just Dance and Assassin's Creed. Much like Rabbids Token turned a classic franchise into something new and compelling with a crypto twist, Pouard acknowledges that they’re looking at other potential franchise extensions.\n\n“Yeah, of course. That’s our work at the Strategic Innovation Lab, to explore the future of the blockchain field and NFTs, so of course we are continuing to explore the field,” he said when asked about potential crypto gaming projects based on existing Ubisoft franchises. “I can say ‘Yeah.’ It’s not a promise, but it’s our work to explore and to see the new kind of opportunities and the way it will change the industry.”\n","read_this_next_post_id":61460,"read_this_next_post_type":"post","social_share_img_url":"https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hashcraft-gID_1.jpg","featured_image_caption":"Ubisoft's blockchain-powered game Hashcraft.

since cryptocurrency miners realized that the graphics processing units (GPUs) used to process the demanding visuals for modern PC games could be turned to the task of crunching numbers to produce crypto, gamers and miners have been at loggerheads. Miners have snapped up stocks of GPUs as soon as they come on the market, sending prices soaring and leaving gamers empty-handed.\n\nThose tensions threatened to burst forth last week, as reports spread that so-called hash-rate limits—applied by GPU manufacturer Nvidia to reduce a chip’s efficiency when mining cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum—had been compromised.\n\nThe news was subsequently debunked, and experts said it was almost impossible to get around the restrictions, which slash RTX 3060 crypto mining capacity by 50%. Subsequently, multiple reports have claimed that a beta driver release bypasses Nvidia’s restrictions.\n\nThe furor highlights growing apprehension in the chip industry, as principal manufacturers Nvidia and AMD seek to accommodate the needs of both gamers and crypto miners. It comes amid a surge in crypto mining revenues that's seen mining operators desperate to buy up inventory—leading to skyrocketing prices for GPUs.\n\nChip manufacturers, meanwhile, are hampered by the scarcity of raw materials needed and confounded by Ethereum’s shift to a proof-of-stake consensus model, which will ultimately do away with mining altogether.\n\nETHEREUM-DEDICATED GPUS\n\nIn February this year, Nvidia launched a dedicated chipset aimed at crypto miners, targeting Ethereum. At the same time, it throttled the hash rate of its new RTX 3060 GPUs in an effort to make them less desirable to crypto miners.\n\nThe chipmakers’ moves came in response to gamers who were concerned about GPU shortages due to demand from miners. Ethereum was specifically targeted because it had the highest mining yield among GPU-mineable coins, according to Nvidia.\n\n\u003e Dammit Chinese mod 🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/dBNjpJQLMl\n\u003e \n\u003e — I_Leak_VN (@I_Leak_VN) March 10, 2021\n\nBut chip shortages have meant that crypto miners have even resorted to gaming laptops to wring out extra hash rate and benefit from bull-run profits. So, for some, it wasn’t so surprising when screenshots, posted by the Twitter account @I_Leak_VN, suggested that enterprising Chinese Ethereum miners had found a way to bypass the restrictions.\n\nLater it transpired that the screenshots weren’t of Ethereum, but another blockchain altogether. Mining experts said that only an Nvidia insider would be able to make the changes needed. However, since then experts from industry publications _PC Watch_, _Computer Base_, and _Hardwareluxx _have debunked _their _claims, revealing that a recent Nvidia beta driver release bypasses the manufacturer's hash rate limits_._\n\n\u003e Nvidia’s new beta driver unlocks RTX 3060 Ethereum cryptocurrency mining https://t.co/XYRJzXUJxQ pic.twitter.com/zj1LZZKwJT\n\u003e \n\u003e — The Verge (@verge) March 15, 2021\n\nMeanwhile, Nvidia’s rival AMD is reportedly developing its own dedicated mining chipset too; the latest version of the AMD Navi 12, initially used for the Apple Macbook Pro. It has no video outputs (which are mandatory for gaming) according to _PC Gamer_. That means the GPU could be the first crypto mining-related specific processor launched by the company, and it specifically targets Ethereum miners.\n\nThese recent moves by both AMD and Nvidia signal attempts to segregate GPUs used for crypto mining, from those used for gaming. But not everyone believes that’s the strategy the multinational should be following. \n\nETHEREUM MINING REVENUES SOAR \n\nEarlier this month, Nvidia won a landmark lawsuit, which dismissed investors’ claims that the chip manufacturer hid its reliance on its burgeoning cryptocurrency mining business to the tune of more than $1 billion. The action was initiated two years ago by investors concerned that Nvidia’s profits were becoming too closely entwined with the volatile cryptocurrency market. But their claims were dismissed due to a lack of evidence that the company misled anyone.\n\nNvidia Wins Lawsuit Over Alleged $1 Billion Crypto Mining Biz\nNow, the situation is somewhat different. A surge in the popularity of crypto mining followed PayPal’s decision to integrate cryptocurrencies and high-profile investor interest. This contributed to a significant surge in GPU sales in Q4 2020, with GPU shipments rising by 20.5% quarter-on-quarter and by 12.4% over Q4 2019, according to a report published this month.\n\nAnalysts, Jon Peddie Research (JPR), who are behind the report, claimed that mining, specifically on the Ethereum network, played a sizeable role. \n\nThis year, Ethereum network fees earned by miners more than doubled, even from last year’s peak during the craze for decentralized finance (DeFi) last summer, and miners saw their revenue triple. No other cryptocurrency comes close to Ethereum for mining profitability right now, according to mining experts.\n\n\u003e The fees are too damn high!\n\u003e \n\u003e Ethereum miner revenue has tripled previous highs reached during this summer's DeFi boom pic.twitter.com/isom1cYavk\n\u003e \n\u003e — Messari (@MessariCrypto) March 4, 2021\n\nThe flip side of this success was that an average transaction fee reached $38.21 on Feb 23, making the network unviable for smaller transactions (and impacting on activity in the burgeoning DeFi space). Ethereum’s ongoing upgrade, Ethereum 2.0, is designed to mitigate those concerns. \n\nIn the meantime, Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin has proposed interim scaling measures. Some community improvement proposals have not gone down well with miners, who fear a reduction in their fees of as much as 50%. A new proposal, EIP-3368, would see block rewards reduced by 0.25 ETH every quarter, helping to ease the impact of Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake on miners.\n\nCoinbase Opens Waitlist for Ethereum 2.0 Staking Rewards\nJPR noted that upcoming changes to the Ethereum ecosystem mean that demand for GPUs among crypto miners is likely to evaporate, as the blockchain network transitions to Eth 2.\n\nHowever, this will take some time. The network will be upgraded in phases, and the last isn’t scheduled to happen until 2022—assuming there are no delays. \n[NVIDIA logo]NVIDIA is one of the world's leading graphic chip producers. Image: Shutterstock\nBy that time, another proof-of-work cryptocurrency could become profitable enough to take Ethereum’s place, but most so-called third-generation blockchains, such as Cardano and Polkadot, have launched with proof of stake—making that rather unlikely. \n\nAnd switching to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoinor other high-profile proof-of-work cryptocurrencies is impossible for miners, because they utilize a different hashing algorithm. \n\nSo, perhaps gamers have little cause to worry—long-term at least.

After all, any of these NFT artifacts can be easily copied—legally or otherwise—by anyone with an Internet connection and a basic familiarity with software.

That certificate is inscribed on a blockchain to create a tamper-proof transaction record to show the world that the artwork—or song or sports highlight—belongs to someone. Think of it as a serial number or a signature from the artist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat this means, at least to NFT boosters, is that they own something unique. Just as an original painting signed by a famous artist is worth millions, even though thousands of college students tape the same image to their dorm room, NFT owners claim that their piece of digital art is the \"real\" one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNonetheless, NFT owners might be surprised to discover that what they \"own\" is rather limited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs law professors like to tell their students, property is like a bundle of sticks. Each stick in the bundle represents a right to do something, such as the right to sell the piece of property, or harvest it or destroy it, and so on. This is certainly true of copyright, which contains more sticks in its bundle—such as the right to broadcast and merchandise an image—than many people realize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the case of sports leagues and musical acts, lawyers are taking pains to ensure their clients keep most of the ownership sticks in the copyright bundle for themselves. For fans, what they receive when buying an NFT is a license that lets them do little beyond display or transfer the work.

What Do You Actually Own?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of these limits go beyond those that go with owning a physical pack of sports cards. In the case of those physical cards—which the NBA likes to invoke as a comparison to NFTs—the owner is free to draw mustaches on the players, or glue the card to a controversial collage. This might not be the case with NFTs. One can imagine a situation in which pro-democracy activists use their NFTs to call attention to the NBA's attempts to cozy up to China, and the league responds by deleting the NFTs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are limits to what you can do with a physical card too, of course. Sports leagues' intellectual property rights mean you can't replicate the card images for a t-shirt business, but the rights are certainly broader than what attaches to these NFTs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eA new form of property brings new forms of piracy\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTonya Evans, an intellectual property scholar at Penn State Dickinson Law, studies blockchains and NFTs and wrote an influential 2018 paper on the CryptoKitties phenomenon. She believes that NFTs offer an important new way for creators to connect and earn money from their fans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShe notes that a number of Black artists have been at the forefront of the NFT craze, using forums like the new social media audio app Clubhouse to market and sell their works. Evans says that the tech underlying NFT provides a way to counteract the Internet's capacity for endless replication and lets artists prove a digital work is unique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"You can code for the integrity of the work,\" said Evans. \"Technology threatened the music industry, letting anyone make a perfect digital copy of the original, and now maybe this is the technology that can cure that.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvans is right that NFT tech offers new opportunities for creators. It's not just prominent artists like Grimes or Beeple that are making real money selling NFTs. So are lesser-known artists, who are using platforms like Nifty Gateway and OpenSea to sell limited edition prints of sneakers and boomboxes. In this sense, NFTs represent a new spigot of money that didn't exist before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"embedded-post\" data-id=61241 data-post-title=\"Can NFTs Change How We Value Music?\" data-post-type=\"post\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://wp.decrypt.co/61241/can-nfts-change-how-we-value-music/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003eCan NFTs Change How We Value Music?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut like everything else on the Internet that makes money, the NFT craze has attracted parasitic bad actors looking to cash in on the works of others.

A potentially more serious one is the emergence of competing blockchain services, each of which promise that \u003cem\u003ethey\u003c/em\u003e provide the authoritative record that a given NFT is unique. The situation is akin to a town having two competing services to register land deeds, or two auction houses each claiming they have the legitimate title to a piece of fine art. The issue is potentially an existential one for the nascent NFT industry, which stakes its existence on being able to prove a given token is unique.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, the main NFT marketplaces are cooperating, with each agreeing to recognize a token as unique even when it passes from one forum to another. But that hasn't stopped the users of Binance’s blockchain from hosting rogue token shops on the network, which not only sold plagiarized works but also clearly \u003ca href=\"https://decrypt.co/60125/binance-smart-chains-musical-beats-alleged-ethereum-copycat-shuts-down-days-after-launch\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003emimicked the store names\u003c/a\u003e of existing Ethereum-based NFT shops—for instance \"Binance Punks\" for \"Crypto Punks\" and \"Bashmasks\" for \"Hashmasks.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"embedded-post\" data-id=60125 data-post-title=\"Binance Smart Chain's Musical Beats, Alleged Ethereum Copycat, Shuts Down Days After Launch\" data-post-type=\"post\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://wp.decrypt.co/60125/binance-smart-chains-musical-beats-alleged-ethereum-copycat-shuts-down-days-after-launch/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003eBinance Smart Chain's Musical Beats, Alleged Ethereum Copycat, Shuts Down Days After Launch\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile trademark and copyright law provides a remedy for rip-offs, it's likely to prove difficult for artists to find and sue an infringer, since blockchains, by their nature, are designed to be borderless and decentralized. This would explain why some upset by recent behavior on Binance's network resorted to non-legal measures to express their displeasure—including \u003ca href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/now/controversial-dapps-test-binance-smart-233029970.html\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003eposting\u003c/a\u003e images from the Tiananmen Square massacre on the company's blockchain. (Binance has ties to China).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch disputes raise the question of whether NFTs represent just the latest headache for creators trying to make a living from their work. But while NFTs can pose a nuisance, some are optimistic these problems are outweighed by the potential for artists to earn a new form of income—and that NFTs could reshape how we view copyright and the Internet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eA breakthrough in the copyright debate?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven since consumers began using it en masse in the mid-1990s, the Internet has proved a mixed blessing for artists, writers, and other creators. On one hand, the web provides an enormous new platform to reach fans and find new audiences. On the other, it's awash with pirates who copy an artist's work and sell it or give it away for nothing. Meanwhile, the giant tech platforms like Amazon and Spotify have come to enjoy virtual monopolies when it comes to selling digital works and, in the view of critics, failed to pay out a fair share to artists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this has led to two decades of debate about copyright policy. The debate is often bitter with the entertainment industry accusing tech enthusiasts of supporting piracy and robbing artists—while opponents accuse the industry of lobbying Congress to pass copyright laws that they view as draconian and prone to abuse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rise of NFTs could help transcend this debate, according to Aaron Wright, a blockchain expert at Cardozo Law School.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I think the Internet has long offered massive distribution for media, but there has been no monetization scheme that works really well,\" he said, adding that NFTs help fix this shortcoming.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSpecifically, Wright points out that NFTs finally offer a way for artists to sell digital versions of their work that are scarce and unique. That scarcity means they can not only enjoy a new revenue stream, but also take a cut when the NFT is resold—an arrangement that platforms like the \u003ca href=\"https://decrypt.co/60918/winklevoss-nft-marketplace-nifty-gateway-valuation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003eWinklevoss-owned Nifty Gateway\u003c/a\u003e help facilitate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom a broader perspective, Wright says artists' ability to sell NFTs could take some of the rancor out of the copyright debate as the business model of online distribution shifts from trying to sell as many copies as possible to selling fewer items for more money to dedicated fans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWright is not the only one who sees a shift in how creators are trying to make money from the Internet. In recent weeks, venture capitalists and tech watchers have been sharing an influential essay called \"\u003ca href=\"https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" rel=\"nofollow external noopener\"\u003e1000 true fans\u003c/a\u003e\" in which \u003cem\u003eWired\u003c/em\u003e editor Kevin Kelly predicted that the future of creative industries would revolve artists selling their work to small communities of passionate supporters. The essay is from a decade ago but, with the arrival of NFTs, Kelly's prediction appears to be coming true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a related trend, tech writer Will Oremus claims that a growing number of Internet users have grown exhausted with mega-platforms like Facebook that rely on algorithms to show a steady stream of emotional or sensational content. He says they are turning instead to smaller forums like SubStack or Clubhouse where \"Super Fans\" can connect in a more intimate community. If Oremus is correct, the growth of these communities will offer creators new opportunities to make money from the Internet—including from NFTs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, such rosy scenarios will depend on NFTs proving they are more than a fad. And many people are skeptical that's the case.

there was a contest for acronym of the year, \"NFT\" would be the clear favorite for 2021. Short for non-fungible tokens, NFTs are having a moment as fans scramble to \"own\" pieces of digital art or pop culture moments.\n\nWhile many people are baffled by the trend, no one can deny it's been lucrative. In recent weeks, buyers have laid down millions of dollars to acquire NFTs issued by the likes of the artist Beeple and the musician Grimes.\n\nBut along with the money and hype, the NFT craze has spurred a debate over what it means to own digital property, and the role of copyright on the Internet. Some suggest NFTs might soothe long-running tensions between creators and tech platforms—while others point out the trend has already given rise to new forms of piracy and rip-offs.\n\nWHAT EXACTLY ARE PEOPLE BUYING?\n\nNFTs are not new. They've been around since 2017 when a company called Dapper Labs began selling NFTs in the form of unique digital cat cartoons called CryptoKitties. Those kitties were the subject of a short-lived craze, and some sold for tens of thousands of dollars before the fad quickly fizzled. Now, in 2021, NFTs have come roaring back as the phenomenon has expanded well beyond digital cats.\n\nToday, the range of NFTs for sale includes just about anything that can be captured as a digital file. The band Kings of Leon, for instance, dropped NFT versions of their new album, while the NBA is selling NFT basketball highlights. An original work by street artist Banksy has been burned and turned into an NFT. And last week, the bidding for an NFT of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey's first tweet topped $2 million.\n\nAll of this raises the question of _just what are people buying_? After all, any of these NFT artifacts can be easily copied—legally or otherwise—by anyone with an Internet connection and a basic familiarity with software. Why pay to \"own\" Jack Dorsey's tweet when you can print out or embed the same tweet on a website like I've done below?\n\n\u003e just setting up my twttr\n\u003e \n\u003e — jack (@jack) March 21, 2006\n\nNFT enthusiasts will tell you that the artifact they bought might look (or sound) identical to copies on the Internet, but _their_ version comes with a unique ownership certificate. That certificate is inscribed on a blockchain to create a tamper-proof transaction record to show the world that the artwork—or song or sports highlight—belongs to someone. Think of it as a serial number or a signature from the artist.\n\nWhat this means, at least to NFT boosters, is that they own something unique. Just as an original painting signed by a famous artist is worth millions, even though thousands of college students tape the same image to their dorm room, NFT owners claim that their piece of digital art is the \"real\" one.\n\nNonetheless, NFT owners might be surprised to discover that what they \"own\" is rather limited.\n\nAs law professors like to tell their students, property is like a bundle of sticks. Each stick in the bundle represents a right to do something, such as the right to sell the piece of property, or harvest it or destroy it, and so on. This is certainly true of copyright, which contains more sticks in its bundle—such as the right to broadcast and merchandise an image—than many people realize.\n\nIn the case of sports leagues and musical acts, lawyers are taking pains to ensure their clients keep most of the ownership sticks in the copyright bundle for themselves. For fans, what they receive when buying an NFT is a license that lets them do little beyond display or transfer the work. Purchasers of NFTs issued by the NBA—called \"Moments\"—can't, for instance, modify the highlight they buy, or display it in a way the league considers hateful or offensive.\n\nSo You Bought an NBA Top Shot NFT. What Do You Actually Own?\nSome of these limits go beyond those that go with owning a physical pack of sports cards. In the case of those physical cards—which the NBA likes to invoke as a comparison to NFTs—the owner is free to draw mustaches on the players, or glue the card to a controversial collage. This might not be the case with NFTs. One can imagine a situation in which pro-democracy activists use their NFTs to call attention to the NBA's attempts to cozy up to China, and the league responds by deleting the NFTs.\n\nThere are limits to what you can do with a physical card too, of course. Sports leagues' intellectual property rights mean you can't replicate the card images for a t-shirt business, but the rights are certainly broader than what attaches to these NFTs.\n\nA NEW FORM OF PROPERTY BRINGS NEW FORMS OF PIRACY\n\nTonya Evans, an intellectual property scholar at Penn State Dickinson Law, studies blockchains and NFTs and wrote an influential 2018 paper on the CryptoKitties phenomenon. She believes that NFTs offer an important new way for creators to connect and earn money from their fans.\n\nShe notes that a number of Black artists have been at the forefront of the NFT craze, using forums like the new social media audio app Clubhouse to market and sell their works. Evans says that the tech underlying NFT provides a way to counteract the Internet's capacity for endless replication and lets artists prove a digital work is unique.\n\n\"You can code for the integrity of the work,\" said Evans. \"Technology threatened the music industry, letting anyone make a perfect digital copy of the original, and now maybe this is the technology that can cure that.\"\n\nEvans is right that NFT tech offers new opportunities for creators. It's not just prominent artists like Grimes or Beeple that are making real money selling NFTs. So are lesser-known artists, who are using platforms like Nifty Gateway and OpenSea to sell limited edition prints of sneakers and boomboxes. In this sense, NFTs represent a new spigot of money that didn't exist before.\n\nCan NFTs Change How We Value Music?\nBut like everything else on the Internet that makes money, the NFT craze has attracted parasitic bad actors looking to cash in on the works of others. That's what happened to an artist who creates digital pictures under the name Weird Undead. She discovered someone has been stealing her images and selling them as NFTs:\n\n\u003e I tried to ignore whole #NFT hysteria but WHAT THE FUCK\n\u003e I don't give any permission (ESPECIALLY to random jerks) to make tokens from my content and I feel so angry pic.twitter.com/E9UKF1AXug\n\u003e \n\u003e — don't give up, skeleton (@WeirdUndead) March 9, 2021\n\nIn the last week, Weird Undead (who asked _Decrypt_ not to use her real name) has been filing a flurry of legal notices with OpenSea—one of the biggest NFT markets—while her fans have been doing the same so as to stop what she calls \"insane and pointless copyright infringement.\" She has also discovered that copycats have been using a service called Tokenized Tweets to create and sell tweets based on her work, and asked it to stop.\n\nMeanwhile, influential figures in the cryptocurrency industry, including Meltem Demirors of CoinShares and Neeraj Agrawal of Coin Center, have complained of random people repackaging their tweets as tokens for sale:\n\n\u003e its pretty annoying\n\u003e \n\u003e — Neeraj K. Agrawal (@NeerajKA) March 9, 2021\n\nHucksters flogging unauthorized tokens are just one part of the emerging piracy problems surrounding NFTs. A potentially more serious one is the emergence of competing blockchain services, each of which promise that _they_ provide the authoritative record that a given NFT is unique. The situation is akin to a town having two competing services to register land deeds, or two auction houses each claiming they have the legitimate title to a piece of fine art. The issue is potentially an existential one for the nascent NFT industry, which stakes its existence on being able to prove a given token is unique.\n\nSo far, the main NFT marketplaces are cooperating, with each agreeing to recognize a token as unique even when it passes from one forum to another. But that hasn't stopped the users of Binance’s blockchain from hosting rogue token shops on the network, which not only sold plagiarized works but also clearly mimicked the store names of existing Ethereum-based NFT shops—for instance \"Binance Punks\" for \"Crypto Punks\" and \"Bashmasks\" for \"Hashmasks.\"\n\nBinance Smart Chain's Musical Beats, Alleged Ethereum Copycat, Shuts Down Days After Launch\nWhile trademark and copyright law provides a remedy for rip-offs, it's likely to prove difficult for artists to find and sue an infringer, since blockchains, by their nature, are designed to be borderless and decentralized. This would explain why some upset by recent behavior on Binance's network resorted to non-legal measures to express their displeasure—including posting images from the Tiananmen Square massacre on the company's blockchain. (Binance has ties to China).\n\nSuch disputes raise the question of whether NFTs represent just the latest headache for creators trying to make a living from their work. But while NFTs can pose a nuisance, some are optimistic these problems are outweighed by the potential for artists to earn a new form of income—and that NFTs could reshape how we view copyright and the Internet.\n\nA BREAKTHROUGH IN THE COPYRIGHT DEBATE?\n\nEven since consumers began using it en masse in the mid-1990s, the Internet has proved a mixed blessing for artists, writers, and other creators. On one hand, the web provides an enormous new platform to reach fans and find new audiences. On the other, it's awash with pirates who copy an artist's work and sell it or give it away for nothing. Meanwhile, the giant tech platforms like Amazon and Spotify have come to enjoy virtual monopolies when it comes to selling digital works and, in the view of critics, failed to pay out a fair share to artists.\n\nAll of this has led to two decades of debate about copyright policy. The debate is often bitter with the entertainment industry accusing tech enthusiasts of supporting piracy and robbing artists—while opponents accuse the industry of lobbying Congress to pass copyright laws that they view as draconian and prone to abuse.\n\nThe rise of NFTs could help transcend this debate, according to Aaron Wright, a blockchain expert at Cardozo Law School.\n\n\"I think the Internet has long offered massive distribution for media, but there has been no monetization scheme that works really well,\" he said, adding that NFTs help fix this shortcoming.\n\nSpecifically, Wright points out that NFTs finally offer a way for artists to sell digital versions of their work that are scarce and unique. That scarcity means they can not only enjoy a new revenue stream, but also take a cut when the NFT is resold—an arrangement that platforms like the Winklevoss-owned Nifty Gateway help facilitate.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, Wright says artists' ability to sell NFTs could take some of the rancor out of the copyright debate as the business model of online distribution shifts from trying to sell as many copies as possible to selling fewer items for more money to dedicated fans.\n\nWright is not the only one who sees a shift in how creators are trying to make money from the Internet. In recent weeks, venture capitalists and tech watchers have been sharing an influential essay called \"1000 true fans\" in which _Wired_ editor Kevin Kelly predicted that the future of creative industries would revolve artists selling their work to small communities of passionate supporters. The essay is from a decade ago but, with the arrival of NFTs, Kelly's prediction appears to be coming true.\n\nIn a related trend, tech writer Will Oremus claims that a growing number of Internet users have grown exhausted with mega-platforms like Facebook that rely on algorithms to show a steady stream of emotional or sensational content. He says they are turning instead to smaller forums like SubStack or Clubhouse where \"Super Fans\" can connect in a more intimate community. If Oremus is correct, the growth of these communities will offer creators new opportunities to make money from the Internet—including from NFTs.\n\nOf course, such rosy scenarios will depend on NFTs proving they are more than a fad. And many people are skeptical that's the case. Those skeptics include Litecoin creator Charlie Lee, a prominent cryptocurrency entrepreneur, who poured cold water on NFTs last week:\n\n\u003e 10/ I will end this thread with this image I found on Reddit. 😂\n\u003e \n\u003e It's funny because it's true. What's the value of an NFT of a song when everyone in the world can own the actual song for $1? pic.twitter.com/jKFY7mxbH6\n\u003e \n\u003e — Charlie Lee [LTC⚡] (@SatoshiLite) March 4, 2021\n\nLee's tweet underscores how the future success of NFTs depends on persuading a critical mass of people that they are worth owning, and that they will keep their value in the future. Doubters may point to the Beanie Babies phenomenon of the 1990s when people paid hundreds or thousands of dollars for $10 stuffed collectibles, only to see the market collapse and never recover.\n\nOn the other hand, each day in 2021 has brought new evidence that people think NFTs are valuable, and will pay good money to own one.\n\nThe latest example? This week, a bidder at Christie's auction house paid $69.3 million to own an NFT artwork by Beeple. It was the third biggest sale by a living artist to date.\n","read_this_next_post_id":61241,"read_this_next_post_type":"post","social_share_img_url":"https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/beeple-nft-everydays-christies-gID_7.jpg","featured_image_caption":"This NFT sold for $69 million at Christie's.

week, the Tennessee rock band Kings of Leon announced they’d be releasing their new album, _When You See Yourself_, as a non-fungible token (NFT) —a digital, blockchain-based collectible. In this case, it works a little like a deluxe edition or a bundle; the NFT comes packaged with a set of MP3s and an animated version of the cover art, as well as a physical copy of the vinyl.\n\nThese perks aren’t nothing, but it’s tempting to view the whole rollout as a cynical attempt to cash in on the hype around NFTs and get the band widespread media attention—and it certainly did. \n\nNFTs are everywhere right now, from the NBA to Taco Bell, and artists like Grimes, Yaeji, and Toro Y Moi have been testing the waters. Grimes sold a collection of visual art for over $6 million; 3LAU, an EDM musician, made $11 million by selling an album as 33 individual NFTs; and Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park has sold several multimedia pieces through the NFT marketplace Zora. The website _XLR8R_ announced a dedicated marketplace for music NFTs earlier this week, and there’s a burgeoning cottage industry of NFT auction houses looking to bring these collectibles to the masses.\n\nMusician 3LAU Sells Album for $11 Million—Using NFTs\nBut behind the early-stage gimmickry is a genuinely intriguing question about the future of artist economies, and the ways we think about how music is owned. The music business has always been about assigning value to something that fundamentally resists precise valuation—who’s to say how much our favorite songs are worth?\n\nFor the better part of the last decade, the answer has been streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music, which offer access to a vast library of recorded music for relatively low fees. Their implicit pitch: access has replaced ownership. (When was the last time you purchased a song through the iTunes Store?) It’s a business model that’s responsible for revitalizing the industry; the decline of physical media sales left a massive hole in the market, and streaming services walked right in. Per the Recording Industry Association of America’s most recent year-end report, streaming now accounts for 83% of the entire industry’s revenue.\n\nBut small artists are getting squeezed harder than ever. The largest streaming services distribute money through a “pro rata” model, which rewards artists in proportion to their total market share: if you’re only listening to your favorite indie artist, your money is still going to Drake and Billie Eilish, since, according to _Rolling Stone _chart data, 90% of what’s streamed on Spotify is music from the top 1% of performers.\n\n“Streaming is a wonderful technology, but because it is dominated by large tech companies, artists, engineers and the like don't have the ability to self-determine value,” said Ben Cronin, a member of the Union of Musicians and Allied Workers. He added that the pro-rata model has ended up gutting a “middle class of musicians” that can’t generate hundreds of millions of streams per month.\n\nSpotify has decided to pay artists about $.003 per stream, but profits can be less than that. Cronin, who’s one half of the electronic duo Gilligan Moss, said his music was streamed 92,000 times in January; he got a check for $8.19.\n\nHere’s a look at whether NFTs have the potential to change how music is valued, and create a new funding source for artists looking to make back some of the money lost to streaming.\n\nWHAT ARE NON-FUNGIBLE TOKENS?\n\nIn finance, assets are “fungibile” when they’re fully interchangeable. Bitcoin is a fungible asset, since each Bitcoin is worth exactly as much as any other. The same goes for dollars, which—though they can be torn or drawn on or otherwise physically altered—are always worth exactly as much as other dollars.\n\nThe idea with NFTs is that each one is unique, one of a kind or one of a very limited batch They’re typically built on the Ethereum network, and can take the form of anything on the Internet. Visual art and music are common use cases, but more intangible things like tweets can be tokenized too. An early example was CryptoKitties, a blockchain-based game focused on collecting digital cat NFTs. The closest analog today might be CryptoPunks—tiny, pixelated images of unique characters, some of which have sold for millions of dollars.\n\nEthereum CryptoPunks Are Selling for Outrageous Sums of Money\n“But wait,” skeptics retort. “Why can’t I just screenshot the same art? Or stream the Kings of Leon album on Spotify or YouTube? What could possibly justify such high prices for things I can access for free online?”\n\nThose are fair questions. Consider Nyan Cat, a looped animation of a cat with a pink Pop-Tart for a torso. It’s a ubiquitous GIF—an artifact from the early-2010s memescape that’s become a piece of Internet history. In celebration of its 10th anniversary, Nyan Cat was turned into an NFT and auctioned through an NFT startup called Foundation, where it sold for 300 ETH, or over $500,000. \n\n“Nyan Cat is an example of where this is going,” Foundation CEO Kayvon Tehranian told _Decrypt_. “Why is something like Nyan Cat going for 300 ETH? Because it's reached that level of stature within the Internet ecosystem. How many people know about that? Hundreds of millions? How many places has that been referenced?”\n\nWhere's the Trust in the $150 Million NFT Art Market?\nFor Tehranian, NFTs are a way of ascribing value to a category of cultural phenomena that people already want to pay for. What was previously replicable and free is now, all of a sudden, discrete and monetizable.\n\n“I think we're headed for a world in which every piece of media that's uploaded to the Internet will be represented as a token,” he said. “And so I think there will be many, many, many, many, many, many forms of value created in that process.”\n\nIt’s a phenomenon that extends well beyond cryptocurrency. What’s valuable about much of contemporary art is less the physical works themselves than the pieces of paper that certify ownership. It’s the same reason knockoff Yeezys aren’t worth anything, even if they’re nearly identical to the real thing, or why expensive sports memorabilia comes with a certificate attesting that it’s really that pitcher’s signature —the fact of authenticity is what you’re paying for, beyond the raw materials. \n\n'Bad Luck Brian' Meme Goes Crypto Art, NFT Sells for $36,000\nWhat you’re really getting with an NFT is a hard and fast certificate of ownership that hypothetically should live forever on a blockchain. Even if you tokenized another Nyan Cat on another platform, it wouldn’t be _the _tokenized Nyan Cat.\n\nThe Grimes and Kings of Leon NFTs were issued in limited editions, which work like prints in the traditional art market; there’s more than one of each, but since the supply is always capped, they still work as collector’s items.\n\nNEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR ARTISTS\n\nRather than just turning a song into an NFT and charging for ownership, the producer Jacques Greene went a step further. After exiting what he characterized as an imperfect publishing deal, he sold an NFT called “Promise” on Foundation, representing the publishing rights to a single of the same name. It’s not something that’s baked into the code of the NFT—instead, it was a “promise” to write the buyer into the contract.\n\nGreene explained that “the last 10-15 years has aggressively told us that music is free and worthless,” and that while less invested fans might still want to buy music on Bandcamp or stream on Spotify, NFTs can be a new option for the diehards. \n\n“The direct line to patronage and putting your money where your mouth is, as far as your passions, is kind of cool,” he said. The buyer for Greene’s single turned out to be Trevor McFedries, who’s responsible for the virtual influencer art project “Lil Miquela,” and the high bid was nearly $24,000.\n\nCharles Damga, who founded the venerable indie label UNO NYC and recently took a job at Foundation, told _Decrypt_ that NFTs are a “much more democratized” funding opportunity for artists. If you ask him, they’re a complement to streaming services as opposed to a replacement. \n\n“I think like NFTs are beautiful in that they put the actual marketplace in the hands of the artists,” Damga said. “There’s interest here, and there's people that want to reward their artists in a real way.”\n\nWhere streaming services decide exactly how much a song is worth, NFTs are a way for artists to directly monetize what they create. Tehranian hopes NFTs will create new markets for creators that had been previously sharing their work for free online via the existing version of the Internet (sometimes referred to as “Web 2.0,” as opposed to an eventual crypto-based “Web 3.0”). “Instead of uploading it for free to a Web 2.0 platform, mint it as a token,” he said. “That token can then be directly monetized by you, by a collector. And then as you build out this collector base, you build out a market for yourself and for your work.”\n\nAnd NFT platforms have commission structures that allow artists to stay tied to their work even after they sell it. On Foundation, the creator of an NFT gets to keep 10% of each subsequent sale on the secondary market. Zora is even more flexible, allowing creators to structure their own royalty payments.\n\nA drawback is that those royalties are platform-specific, meaning that if you want to buy and NFT on Zora and resell it on Rarible, the creator isn’t getting exactly the same percentage. But the NFT itself will live in your wallet as long as the Ethereum network is up and running; if Zora and Rarible collapse tomorrow, existing NFTs won’t go anywhere.\n\nMat Dryhurst, an artist and technologist who hosts a podcast on Internet culture with his wife, the composer Holly Herndon, said that blockchain-based systems are “light years ahead” of streaming when it comes to prioritizing artists, and that NFTs are a way of rejecting platform risk. In contrast to Web 2.0, where a few big companies dominate, the protocols and smart contracts of the Web 3.0 era offer a chance to reconsider how value is distributed, and to whom.\n\n“We've been living in this very docile state for 10 to 12 years where we just take what we're given,” he said. “Protocol thinking is: ‘What you want to do with these basic elements?’ and figure out a way to do it. Because if you do, and many will, I think the next 10 years will be very exciting.”\n\n“It’s definitely more invigorating than just sitting around complaining about Spotify,” Greene said. “For the first time there's like, wow, something new that feels like there could be something here, and it’s kind of a nice feeling.”\n\nEXCLUSIVITY, SCARCITY, AND BAD ART\n\nThe flip side of this is an exclusivity problem: Jacques Greene can move an NFT for $24,000 because he’s a respected musician with a sizable following, and also because he’s embedded in the crypto community online. Foundation is an invite-only platform, and Greene got involved through Damga, with whom he’s had a decade-long relationship.\n\n“Privilege in the cryptocurrency space is a huge, huge issue in terms of the barrier to entry and the people who are natively in the space,” said Damga.\n\nThose people who are “natively in the space” have already established aesthetic norms which may deter certain kinds of artists. \n\nMany of the most popular NFTs tend to feature images of Elon Musk, the Shiba Inu “doge” meme, and rocket emojis, along with plenty of Bitcoin logos and references to pop culture; they’re usually garish and didactic, pandering to the “extremely online” ethos of crypto’s wealthiest patrons. The digital artist Beeple makes flashy, sensationalist images in this vein (they might remind you of KAWS or Jeff Koons), which have been described by _Spike Art Magazine_ as “a very boring sort of outsider art, made by nerds for other nerds.” He just sold a piece at Christie’s for $69 million; it was the third-highest price ever paid at auction for work by a living artist.\n\nBeeple NFT Artwork Sells for $69.3 Million in Christie’s Auction\nMat Dryhurst suggested that headline-grabbing sales numbers and off-putting, explicitly crypto-themed artworks might not be a good indication of where NFTs are heading, or what they can do for the value of music. “For most people, right now, when they see crypto or blockchain and art, likely all they've seen is a Beeple GIF, and people making market memes on Twitter. I can understand why that would be kind of alienating. I'm not all that excited about that aspect of it.”\n\nEven beyond these visual signifiers, there’s a danger in thinking about art as a product. The music that Grimes, Kings of Leon, and others have turned into NFTs is usually available to stream for free online, and paying thousands of dollars for a music NFT doesn’t preclude anyone else from listening—at least not always. For her first NFT release, Azealia Banks sold a one-of-one audio sex tape to a pseudonymous buyer for $17,000, and hasn’t released it elsewhere. As with the Wu-Tang Clan’s selling the only copy of _Once Upon a Time in Shaolin_ to the fraudster Martin Shkreli, it’s a model premised on exclusion.\n\nJack Dorsey: Proceeds From Tweet NFT Will Go to Africa Relief Charity\nAccording to Mat Dryhurst, without guardrails, this sort of gatekeeping is “inevitable.” The protocols behind NFTs are just tools like any other: they’re neither exploitative nor inherently pro-artist. It’s the people behind the keyboard, coding these things into existence, who decide how equitable these systems can be.\n\n“There's nothing stopping people from using these tools to create a co-op in which all profits are immediately on chain, distributed between everybody involved,” said Dryhurst. “You can build whatever utopian projects you see fit here, but I just don't think people are even in the habit of thinking about it.”\n\nTo be sure, a certain degree of exclusivity is inherent to the value proposition of NFTs. EulerBeats is a project looking to turn music into a pure investment play, with a set of 27 algorithmically generated audio tracks in the form of NFTs. (Euler Beats is funded by Ethereum studio ConsenSys, which also funds an editorially independent _Decrypt._) For each “beat” you own, you’re entitled to 8% of what it sells for on the secondary market. Billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban has framed EulerBeats as a great money-making opportunity. But shouldn’t the value of music be tied to the music itself, rather than the potential to be flipped for a quick buck?\n\n\u003e i fully respect the view of those who want nothing to do w the space, but the idea of assets on the blockchain isnt going away. there is a small window to try establish some norms or values that might have real value moving forward. doing nothing now lets the predators define it\n\u003e \n\u003e — ཊལབསརངཧ (@David_Rudnick) March 3, 2021\n\nThis sort of dynamic isn’t specific to crypto; it already exists among vinyl resellers, where rare, limited edition presses are considered investments. That it’s so easily replicated supports Dryhurst’s idea that when it comes to the crypto ecosystem, we’re only limited by how big we’re thinking. The companies that dominate the current version of the Internet have already set their terms, exploitative or not. In the crypto space, there’s a chance for artists to drive the conversation about what comes next.\n\nECOLOGICAL COST\n\nSome artists have already written off NFTs entirely, since crypto as an industry is extremely energy-intensive. The Bitcoin network’s current annualized electricity consumption is now nearly 130 TWh, according to research from the University of Cambridge’s Center for Alternative Finance; for context, the entire country of Ukraine used about 129 TWh in 2019. \n\nEthereum, the blockchain most NFTs run on, uses around 26 TWh. But the disparity is more a function of transaction volume than consumption rates: Bitcoin is still crypto’s big dog, with a market capitalization that exceeds Ethereum’s by a factor of about five. With greater demand comes greater energy expenditures.\n\nThe Truth About Bitcoin's Green New Deal\nCrypto’s energy problem has to do with something called a “proof-of-work” consensus mechanism. When you initiate a Bitcoin or Ethereum transaction, there’s no single governing body that verifies it and then carries it out (as with a bank). Instead, the transaction is sent out to a network of computers, each of which is tasked with performing a difficult math problem; the first computer to solve the problem gets to verify the transaction in exchange for newly created (or “mined’) crypto. It’s an intentionally resource-intensive process, since the “work” of solving the math problem is what “proves” a transaction is legit.\n\nFacilities known as crypto mines are dedicated entirely to this process, and form the bedrock of the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks. These are essentially just rows of computers and accompanying cooling systems, whose only function is to crunch numbers in the hopes of being rewarded with crypto. Cambridge’s data suggests over 70% of the computational power behind Bitcoin is coming from China, which is still heavily reliant on cheap coal.\n\nOffsetra, a group that brokers carbon offsets for companies looking to reduce their climate impact, is already working with the NFT marketplaces Zora and KnownOrigin. “You have all these computers that are basically just computing smashing numbers together, securing the network,” said Offsetra analyst Drew Bonneau. “And you end up having a race to the bottom of energy usage for Bitcoin miners.”\n\nCarbon.fyi, Offsetra’s calculator for the emissions output of individual addresses on the Ethereum blockchain, formed the basis of Cryptoart.wtf, which was a similar tool developed by the researcher Memo Akten specifically for NFTs. Akten took the site down on Friday, citing its role in “abusement and harassment” toward artists experimenting with NFTs.\n\n\u003e I'm thankful @memotv disabled https://t.co/j7amLQ1u6z . I agree 100% we have a responsibility to be critical of businesses, and to fight for systemic change. I disagreed with the focus on artists, but he sparked an important conversation and I hope it leads to change we all want. pic.twitter.com/s4ivL7ri3M\n\u003e \n\u003e — Sterling Crispin 🕊️ (@sterlingcrispin) March 12, 2021\n\nIn a post criticizing Grimes, singer-songwriter Lucy Dacus wrote that “NFTs are destructive and irresponsible,” and Jaime Brooks, who records as Default Genders, has called NFTs an “ecologically wasteful” vanity project.\n\nCharles Damga acknowledged the environmental impact of NFTs, and said he wants to address artists’ concerns head-on. “It’s not falling on deaf ears. We’re not like the car industry, saying ‘It’s not our responsibility, go talk to the gas companies.’ It’s very much an egalitarian, forward-thinking community that you’re entering. You decide whether a lack of a voice is louder than a voice that’s going to come in and be progressive.”\n\nArtStation Rethinks NFT Crypto Art Push After Environmental Backlash\nThere’s also a glimmer of hope in the form of Ethereum 2.0—the network’s long-awaited shift away from proof-of-work in favor of proof-of-stake, a far less wasteful consensus mechanism. And blockchains like Flow and Wax are already using proof-of-stake. While there’s no set timeline for Ethereum to actually make the jump, progress is being made slowly but surely.\n\nUntil that day comes, does the environmental toll—and the stigma that can come with it—outweigh the potential benefits for artists considering jumping into NFTs?\n\n“For me, it very much comes down to like, are you happy with the existing dynamics on Web 2.0?\" Dryhurst said. “If you’re not, there is a new world being built.\"\n","read_this_next_post_id":61248,"read_this_next_post_type":"post","social_share_img_url":"https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shutterstock_1036028215-Cropped-scaled-gID_1.jpg","featured_image_caption":"","featured_image_description":"","featured_image_url":"https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shutterstock_1036028215-Cropped-scaled-gID_1.jpg","primary_category":{"term_id":23621,"name":"Features","slug":"features","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":23621,"taxonomy":"category","description":"Deep dives into Web 3.0, future and present.","parent":0,"count":1,"filter":"raw"}}},{"id":61248,"date":"2021-03-13T11:27:53","date_gmt":"2021-03-13T11:27:53","guid":{"rendered":"https://wp.decrypt.co/?p=61248"},"modified":"2021-03-13T11:27:53","modified_gmt":"2021-03-13T11:27:53","slug":"this-tennis-pro-is-auctioning-part-of-her-arm-as-an-nft","status":"publish","type":"post","link":"https://wp.decrypt.co/61248/this-tennis-pro-is-auctioning-part-of-her-arm-as-an-nft/","title":{"rendered":"This Tennis Pro is Auctioning Part of Her Arm as an NFT"},"content":{"rendered":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eNon-fungible tokens, or \u003cspan class=\"link\"\u003e\u003ca alt=\"What are NFTs?\" href=\"https://decrypt.co/resources/non-fungible-tokens-nfts-explained-guide-learn-blockchain\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003eNFTs\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, have taken the world by storm in recent weeks, giving artists, musicians, and other creatives the opportunity to tokenize their work and amass millions—\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://decrypt.co/61201/metakovan-beeple-purchase\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003ein some cases\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e—by making it cryptographically unique on blockchain.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eOleksandra Oliynykova, 20, is not a digital artist, or a musician, or in any way known in the crypto space.

She is a professional tennis player who minted her first NFT on Wednesday—her first and last, she says.\n\nThe tennis professional, who has an International Tennis Federation (ITF) World Tour Ranking of 30 and Women's Tennis Association (WTA) ranking of 649, is offering one prospective buyer the lifetime rights to part of her right arm. To be more specific, it’s the section on the inside of her upper arm just above the elbow; a total area of 15cm x 8cm (approximately 6 inches x 3 inches.)\n\nThat may sound like a small patch of real estate to anyone unfamiliar with the world of sports merchandising. But in the tennis world, that part of the body amounts to a billboard in Times Square; the winning bidder could re-sell it, leave it blank, or commission a tattoo or a piece of body art on that area. \n\nIt would be visible every time she raises her right arm to take a shot at Wimbledon, or the French Open; it would be on prime display at all of the 20 or so tournaments she takes part in every year, and it could well be the start of a global trend in individual-player sports.  \n\nNFTS: STORMING INTO SPORTS\n\nNFTs are not new in the sports arena. Some of the most successful have been launched by the National Basketball League via a collectors' site called NBA Top Shot. \n\nTo date, collectors have spent $330 million on 10-15 second clips from games on Top Shot; an official game highlight from a star player can go for up to $200,000. And last week, National Football League star Rob Gronkowski minted a collection of Super Bowl NFTs.\n[Oleksandra Oliynykova]At 20, Oleksandra Oliynykova has a long career ahead of her; a tattoo or artwork may be on show at the biggest tennis locations in the world. Image: Oleksandra Oliynykova\n“My dream is [that] this process is led by athletes, not sports corporations,” Oliynykova told _Decrypt_ on Friday on a call from her home in Zagreb, Croatia. “I believe my NFT is the first of its kind made by an athlete in [an] individual sport, directly—without club, league, or sports agency mediation.” \n\nShe and her father Denis Oliynyk, who is also her manager, hope that collectors, investors, and brands will see the opportunity to make sports history—and that other athletes will follow in Oliynykova’s wake. The technology could make waves in the sports industry, just as it already disrupting arts, gaming collectibles, and more.\n\nA REFUGEE TENNIS PRO\n\nThe world of individual-player sports is a tough one. Without support, young players can struggle to find the funds to travel to major tournaments, said Oliynyk. \n\nHis daughter is unsponsored. Funding is not distributed by merit, he said. “There is a pool of talented individual athletes who have never had a chance to shine.”\n\nThe Oliynyks are originally from Ukraine. They fled to Croatia from Odessa in 2011, claiming political asylum. Coached by her father (who has never played tennis), Oliynykova became an all-court player—the top Croatian female under 18 listed by the WTA. But with success came misfortune. \n\nWhen Oliynykova was granted a Croatian passport, she was no longer entitled to the funds of $1,500 a month she had been receiving under an Olympic scholarship program for refugees—despite the fact that she has no other source of funding, apart from her delivery-driver father, who is still technically a refugee himself. \n\nAs a consequence, she could no longer afford to play at a junior level, and has been at senior level since 2017—meaning that it’s a much slower process for her to rise in the federation ranks than for a player who was able to benefit by playing against other juniors for longer. \n\nOliynykova expects her new tattoo, or body art (or blank space) to be in place by the time she plays at the ITF tournament in Portugal in April (Covid permitting). She already has nine tattoos, most notably the “2006” on the front of her neck, which is the year when she began to play tennis.\n\n The individual player is actually the ideal token because his career is transparent.\n\nShe’s given her consent for any image which the NFT buyer wants to place on her arm, as long as it’s not racist or extreme. The only other stipulation is that it can’t contain anything related to gambling or betting in order to fulfill regulations imposed by the tennis authorities. \n\nNFTs most often use the Ethereum blockchain, and bidding for Oliynykova’s scrap of skin starts at 3 WETH, the tradable version of Ethereum’s cryptocurrency, which is used on the OpenSea digital marketplace. The fiat value is $5,212. \n\nIf the owner opts to place a temporary tattoo or body art in the spot, the Oliynyks have stipulated a fee of 1 ETH ($1,777) for every \"clean-and-paint\" cycle.\n\nTENNIS AND TOKENIZATION\n\nWhile her arm is the only place on her body where Oliynykova is offering an NFT, the duos’ plans to integrate cryptocurrency in the tennis pro’s career doesn’t stop there. \n\nOne alternative they are considering—as an NFT—is a season of athlete management privileges, “like in fantasy sports, but in the real-life!” said Oliynykova. “So you can define a player's schedule and dress code, sit in her player's box, represent her in the media, etc.”\n[Oleksandra Oliynykova NFT]The NFT artwork (or blank space, if the buyer desires) will be visible on the most prominent part of a tennis player's body. Image: Oleksandra Oliynykova.\nOliynykova has already waded into the larger crypto community by becoming a player ambassador for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which she claims is useful when athletes need to convert funds while traveling in other countries.\n\nRather than one-shot NFTs, the father-daughter duo is most keenly interested in the longer-term benefits of tokenization, where an athlete offers his fanbase an opportunity to participate in his career, through issuing tokens. “The individual player is actually the ideal token because his career is transparent,” said Oliynyk. This makes it easy to judge whether he/she is doing well, he explained. And stakeholders can share in the dividends from this success. \n\nBeeple NFT Artwork Sells for $69.3 Million in Christie’s Auction\nAll eyes are on the NFT space right now. While some experts question the huge sums raised, one artist made $69 million for an NFT this week, and others have made millions by copying or burning original art and transforming it into NFTs. \n\nMeanwhile, Malta-based sports tokenization platform Chiliz has been notching up partnerships with major European soccer teams—including AC Milan and FC Barcelona since the beginning of 2020 and recently invested $50 million in its US expansion. \n\nIn this light, Oliynykova’s plans for her right arm don’t seem as outlandish as they may have a few weeks ago. She may even give new meaning to the term \"tennis elbow.\" \n","read_this_next_post_id":58154,"read_this_next_post_type":"post","social_share_img_url":"https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Image-3-12-21-at-6.56-PM-gID_5.jpeg","featured_image_caption":"Oleksandra Oliynykova has an ITF World Tour Rank of 30, and is ranked 649 by the WTA.

Palmer (not his real name) has—had?—about 20 Bitcoin, which as of this year's bull run, would make him a millionaire.\n\n“In the early 2010s, I was one of those geeks excited to buy a pizza slice with Bitcoin,” he told _Decrypt_. “I even got my first Bitcoin for that purpose—except, by the time a pizza joint in my town started accepting Bitcoin, I’d already forgotten the damn password.”\n\nAs Bitcoin's price ebbs and flows, his feelings are ambivalent—particularly when the cryptocurrency surges to a new all-time-high. But he's not alone in his predicament—there are many Bitcoin holders who've been locked out of their wallets, unable to access their funds as their value spirals ever higher.\n\nIn fact, a whole industry of wallet recovery specialists has sprung up to cater to that glaring need—in many cases, founded by individuals who've lost a crypto password themselves, and have turned their painful experience into a full-fledged profession.\n\nAs _Decrypt_ found out in conversations with wallet specialists and those trying to get their wallet back, it’s a psychological endeavour as much as it is a technical one.\n\nINTROSPECTIVE FORENSICS\n\nDanny Thomas, a 37-year-old American food delivery worker, is an early Dogecoin investor. He traded on Reddit’s r/dogemarket in 2013—the prime Dogecoin exchange at the time. By early 2014, his dedicated efforts in the Dogecoin NASCAR sponsorship drive brought his crypto balance to 300,000 DOGE—worth over $16,000 today.\n\nAround the same time, rumors of crypto-stealing malware started sweeping through the Internet; r/dogemarket rang alarm bells, and Thomas took necessary precautions.\n\n“I set my password to something I knew I would never forget,” he told _Decrypt_, “which I technically didn’t—I never forgot the context of the password but never managed to get the exact formatting right.”\n\n“Most people often have a hunch what their password might be, but they can’t quite put their finger on it,” Niels Zondervan, founder of Wallet Recovery NL, told _Decrypt_.\n\nZondervan asks his clients to try and recreate the environment in which they first set the password, so that the range of possibilities can be narrowed. “When creating a password, humans almost always use clues from their environment,” he explains. That can be a TV show character, or a postcode.\n\nHow To Keep Your Bitcoin Safe And Secure\nWallet recovery can sometimes feel like one-sided speed dating. “We try to ask as many questions as possible to create a mental image of that person's world,” Robert Rhodin, CEO of wallet recovery company KeychainX, explained.\n\nTo his annoyance, Palmer can’t partake of that psychological game. He—unlike Thomas—has no frame of reference (“no, it’s not something like p1zza”, he said); his password exists in a contextual void.\n\n\u003e How we recovered a Bitcoin wallet from 2013! https://t.co/fWpwbxRBCI #Bitcoin #cryptocurrencies #passwords #recovery\n\u003e \n\u003e — KeychainX (@KeychainX) December 15, 2020\n\n“It was a totally random string of characters that I knew would be unhackable, something like VBhfnyhjfLBw79!,” Palmer said. He'd jotted it down on a piece of paper that he has since lost.\n\n“The more meticulous about security you are, the harder it is for me to help,” Dave Bitcoin (as he’s professionally known), founder of Wallet Recovery Services, told _Decrypt_. “If a customer suggests a wide range of apparently random possibilities, then chances are going to be much lower,” he said, giving a modest and yet unmistakably honest success rate estimate of around 35%.\n\n“But my success rate continues to improve as my system evolves to be faster and smarter about the passwords it tests,” he said.\n\nIt is also this shared belief in technical progress that keeps Palmer (not David’s client) sanguine about his future riches.\n\nCUTTING THROUGH THE DISTRUST\n\nThe early crypto ethos that begat non-custodial wallets—where you don't trust a bank or a third party with your wallet keys—also undermined the trust necessary to seek help from others.\n\n“The general feeling at the time was that you should never give your wallet or private keys to anyone, as no one could be trusted,” David Bitcoin explained.\n\nTo earn the business of a target clientele who is almost programmed to distrust, wallet recovery specialists had to prove themselves first.\n\nIn some cases, that involved IRL meetings—exceptionally rare for an otherwise exclusively online community. “An African man flew over to meet us in person,” Rhodin said. After having wined and dined with them, he handed over a note “with tens of different passwords containing a massive list of family members.” He’d forgotten the twenty-fifth word to a passphrase on his Trezor hardware wallet. The password did indeed end up being a family member's name—but irregularly capitalized.\n\n10 years ago, a man lost Bitcoin that's now worth $100 million\nIt’s not just the clients who need to be trusting, however.\n\n“After every price surge,” Zondervan told _Decrypt_, “there’s a multitude of people inquiring about my services.” The majority of those inquiries—about 60%—come from “shady guys from the dark web” who stole a wallet or bought a stolen wallet, hoping to leave the dirty work to recovery specialists, he explained.\n\nZondervan, like others in the business, has developed an eye for genuine clients. “Some clients are anxious and want immediate results, while others are more patient, understanding that it’s not a quick task,” he said, “the psychological reaction differs, but there’s always something that feels real about them.” In his experience, the psychological reaction varies by educational background and technical aptitude—not how much the wallet contains.\n\nIF ALL ELSE FAILS\n\nIt’s not how much the wallet contains—of which they take a commission, often around 10%—that necessarily motivates wallet recovery specialists. “There are many people who have invested their life savings in cryptocurrency,” said David Bitcoin, “and in some parts of the world this may only be $500.”\n\nDavid Bitcoin once worked with an Indian client who didn’t have much in his wallet, compared to some hodlers. “But opening his wallet enabled him to see his daughter because now he could afford the alimony.”\n\nTHE PRICE OF FAILURE\n\nDespite the best efforts of recovery specialists—both psychological and technical—some wallets will remain sealed.\n\nLast month, Rhodin had to deal with several clients who entered the wrong PIN three times on a self-destroying Ledger hardware wallet. Their Bitcoin has now been transferred to the ever-growing junkyard of 3.7 million Bitcoin—around 20% of the current Bitcoin supply—that might be lost forever, according to the most recent estimates.\n\nLost Bitcoin: 3.7 million Bitcoin are probably gone forever\nBut the biggest impact when someone loses access to their Bitcoin isn't necessarily the material wealth; it's something more intangible. Prudy Gourguechon, a psychoanalyst who writes for _Forbes_ on the psychology of money, told _Decrypt_ that while they haven't actually lost anything beyond their initial investment, “what they’ve lost is a fantasy—how wonderful life would be if they had access to those Bitcoin riches.”\n\n“I once had a client who, for the first time in their life, experienced riding the Metro—as opposed to being chauffeured,” she said. “That person is an example of someone who lost a great deal of wealth, going from being ultra-wealthy to the middle class.”\n\n$7 Billion “Lost” and HODLed Bitcoin Found Since Start of Bull Run\nTo help put the issue into perspective, she proposed a “change-in-class test” of some sort: “Is there really a change in class for those who lost Bitcoin passwords? They’ll just keep on living the same life.”\n\nShe suggested a therapist to anyone still struggling with the loss of their fantasy after a month’s time.\n\nBut Thomas admitted he had another method of last resort in mind—that is, if he hadn’t received the good news from Rhodin two weeks ago.\n\n“If the wallet recovery service hadn’t worked out and Dogecoin kept rising,” he said, “I would have sought a hypnotist to get my repressed memory unlocked.”\n","read_this_next_post_id":59635,"read_this_next_post_type":"post","social_share_img_url":"https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/bitcoin-maze-gID_2.jpg","featured_image_caption":"Around 20% of Bitcoin's supply has been lost.

senior official from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) rejected claims that the bank has ever banned crypto, reported local media outlet _Today NG_.\n\nThe CBN official, Adamu Lamtek, reportedly said that the bank protected the banking sector from cryptocurrencies—it didn't ban crypto trading itself.\n\nThe clarification comes more than a month after Nigeria’s central bank told all banks to immediately cancel their services for customers who buy, sell, or trade cryptocurrencies. It isn't clear what prompted the bank’s decision.\n\n“The CBN did not place restrictions from use of [sic] cryptocurrencies and we are not discouraging people from trading in it,” Lamtek was quoted as saying in _Today NG_. “What we have just done was to prohibit transactions on cryptocurrencies in the banking sector.\"\n\nLamtek spoke on behalf of the governor of the bank, Godwin Emefiele, and reportedly disclosed this at a recent meeting for journalists held by the bank in the Nigerian city Abuja.\n\nBut these words shouldn’t be taken as the Nigerian government endorsing crypto; the Central Bank has no jurisdiction over who can trade cryptocurrencies to begin with, explained Danny Oyekan, CEO of investment firm Dan Holdings and social payments app Coins App.\n\nCrypto is under the jurisdiction of Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission. Back in September, Nigeria’s SEC announced plans to regulate the crypto sector by deeming cryptocurrencies securities until proven otherwise.\n\nDespite the regulatory uncertainty, Nigeria is often called Africa’s Bitcoin Nation as the country’s crypto trading volume outpaces most other countries in the world.\n\nTHE POST-BAN NIGERIAN CRYPTO INDUSTRY\n\nIt’s been just over a month since the Nigerian Central Bank’s ban on financial institutions dealing with crypto companies came into force.\n\nBut the Nigerian crypto industry hasn’t died out. “The industry has shown resilience and quickly adapted by developing peer-to-peer exchanges,” Oyekan told _Decrypt_. “That’s not an easy feat to accomplish in 1-2 months.”\n\nIn response to the ban, OTC deals are still underway and the informal peer-to-peer market is also growing, explained Oyekan.\n\n“So basically, the ban only forced the fiat channels underground.”\n","read_this_next_post_id":62258,"read_this_next_post_type":"post","social_share_img_url":"https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/africa-nigeria-bitcoin-trading-volume-gID_4.jpg","featured_image_caption":"The Central Bank of Nigeria and crypto have a confusing history.

The project allows banks in Hong Kong and Thailand to send funds to each other via smart contracts.\n\nHong Kong and Thailand complete digital currency prototype\nIt’s not only the financial service in which Thailand wants to exploit crypto. It also wants to promote its tourism with crypto; “Even Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and a crypto influencer, might be interested in visiting Thailand,” Yuthasak Supasorn, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), told _The Bangkok Post_ last month.\n\nMeanwhile, earlier this month, the country attempted to adopt a restrictive approach toward local crypto investors and traders, only to take a step back after public backlash.\n\nThailand's Securities and Exchange Commission had to walk back a draft proposal that would have required crypto investors to have a minimum annual income of one million baht ($33,000).\n\nThat threshold would have prevented low-and middle-income individuals from investing in cryptocurrency.\n\nBut the subtext is indelible: Thailand is up for crypto, but by its own rules.\n","read_this_next_post_id":62249,"read_this_next_post_type":"post","social_share_img_url":"https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/shutterstock_1161170686-gID_1.jpg","featured_image_caption":"","featured_image_description":"Bank o' Thailand.

content with resting at the top of the premier league, English soccer team Manchester City has its sights set on the even more prestigious—for _Decrypt _readers anyway—crypto league. \n\nThe club has partnered with tokenization platform Socios.com to launch a new $CITY token that offers fans the ability to claim VIP rewards, club promotions, AR-enabled features, and a vote in upcoming binding and non-binding club polls on Socios’s website. \n\nSocios has partnered with top tier clubs before. Juventus, AC Milan, Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain have all put out tokens through the Socios platform before, which is run by Malta-based crypto project Chiliz. \n\n\u003e Welcome\n\u003e To https://t.co/2FROhSNgw8, @ManCity.#SociosCity | $CITY ⚡️ $CHZ pic.twitter.com/25vvA6GyqB\n\u003e \n\u003e — Socios.com (@socios) March 19, 2021\n\nAnd, if the $CITY token wasn’t enough, Man City is also partnering with digital entertainment company Animoca to create blockchain games and collectibles. These will be the first soccer-related digital assets created by Animoca. \n\n$CITY TOKENS ARE FUNGIBLE\n\nMan City’s designs on the digital asset world are two-pronged in scope. The $CITY token is what’s called a ‘fungible’ token. This means that the Socios tokens can be traded like any other cryptocurrency, and redeemed for goods and services throughout the cryptoverse. \n\nAll registered Cityzens, (fans signed up to the official fan club), are eligible to claim one free $CITY token. According to an announcement on the club’s website, the $CITY token “creates a new layer of digital engagement for Manchester City’s global fanbase, bringing them even closer to the club they love.”\n\nIt’s possibly a new start for the club’s bookkeepers, who have come under close scrutiny following a two-year ban from European club competitions for “disguising equity funds as sponsorship contributions.” The ban was overturned on appeal and the club was cleared by the Court of Arbitration for Sport last year. \n\nTHE OTHER CITY GOODIES WILL BE NON-FUNGIBLE\n\nThrough their partnership with Animoca, Manchester City is keenly jumping on the current gold rush for digital collectibles. Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital collectibles that can prove their uniqueness in code on the Ethereum blockchain’s distributed ledger. In short, they are a form of verifiable digital scarcity that can’t be counterfeited by rewriting or replacing values on Ethereum’s indelible blockchain. \n\nNFTs have become much more than just a hobby horse in the art world, where a single NFT token, in the form of a piece of digital art, can sell for as much as $69.3 million. \n\nBut American sports organisations already sighted the gold rush. After licensing digital developer Dapper Labs in 2019, the NBA released a line of digital trading cards that have been selling like hot cakes. NBA Top Shots have recorded $32 million in trading volume in a single day and, at their height, sold 2,673 booster packs of Series 2 Holo cards in half an hour on launch, amounting to a pretty sum of $2.6 million. \n\nAmerican Football has been getting in on the action too. While the NFL doesn’t have a set of digital trading cards yet, individual players  have been getting in on the action. Earlier this year, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Rob Gronkowski released Championship Series NFT trading cards of his Super Bowl wins on digital collectible marketplace Opensea. They’ve currently set the record for highest value sport NFTs, netting him $1.6 million at auction. \n\nThere’s clearly ample room for soccer NFTs too. An NFT of Portuguese soccer legend Christiano Ronaldo broke records and became the highest selling digital soccer collectible after it sold for $290k on Sorare. \n\nRaheem Sterling will need a fresh pair of legs to keep up with that. \n\n\u003e Semis booked 🧘🏿‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/2Sb2gENZ50\n\u003e \n\u003e — Raheem Sterling (@sterling7) March 20, 2021\n\n","read_this_next_post_id":62231,"read_this_next_post_type":"post","social_share_img_url":"https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shutterstock_1220891686-gID_6.jpg","featured_image_caption":"","featured_image_description":"The Logo of Manchester City Football Club.

It only took a couple of days for people to ransack the project and liberate 25,344 cats, which now trade for an average of $1,800.\n\nAn Ancient NFT Project Called MoonCats Is Eating Up Ethereum\nPrecisely 160 black and white “Genesis MoonCats” remain locked up, and only the pseudonymous developers of the project, Ponderware, have the power to release them to new, loving owners. These cats are finer than the rest and proud owners of some of the Genesis Cats already in circulation have sold them for about $100,000 apiece.\n\nIn anticipation of their release, some people have set up bots to catch the cats as soon as the developers release them. These front-running bots run a simple if-then command: _if_ a Genesis MoonCat goes up for adoption, (_then_) the bot buys it automatically.\n\nThe developers and MoonCat holders are concerned that these bots will ruin the fun and are thinking of locking up the remaining Genesis MoonCats forever. “Most people don't know how to program their own bots, explained Foobar, a MoonCats holder and a community developer who \"aped in\" last week and rescued around 50 cats. “So it feels unfair—the common man wants a chance.”\n\n\u003e Just made my first $1 on the Internet. Used web3 knowledge to scrape Infura for current Mooncat offers, picked up 5 at 0.05 ETH while the OpenSea floor was 0.4. Feels good to have my first programmable arbitrage, +1.5 ETH ($3k). Not bad for an hour's work!\n\u003e \n\u003e — foobar (@seeker_curious) March 12, 2021\n\nBecause bots aren’t illegal, and there’s no easy way to prevent them from snapping up the remaining Genesis MoonCats, the project’s pseudonymous developers, Ponderware, have set up a vote to determine whether to destroy the private key to the remaining 160 Genesis MoonCats, locking them in their cages forever.\n[mooncats-adoption-center]MoonCats Rescue Adoption Center, the project's custom-made marketplace for NFTs\n\"The sort of people who would run them are those looking to make a profit by exploiting loopholes,” sniffed Brooks Boyd, a developer familiar with the MoonCats code who rescued his first a few days after MoonCats launched in August 2017.\n\n\u003e Well, since #MoonCats seems to be \"a thing\" again, showing off the oldest one in my collection: cat ID 0x000d56f279, rescued Aug-14-2017. 😺 pic.twitter.com/ROcU5jUpEX\n\u003e \n\u003e — Brooks Boyd (@midnight426) March 12, 2021\n\nCOMPLETIONISTS AND GIVEAWAYS\n\nBoyd said that it’s not just opportunists who want the developers to release the remaining Genesis MoonCats. Locking them up would render the project incomplete. “Even if the last 160 are to be locked away forever after they're released, I think that should be done conclusively (on-chain), \"so the on-chain view of the project (which will outlive us!) would reflect that.\"\n\n\u003e To be clear, if the vote is for us keeping the key, new questions arise. A fair distribution of those cats may prove technically, socially, and/or economically impossible. We will work with the community to meet the challenge, but it is likely to be a complex and drawn-out issue.\n\u003e \n\u003e — ponderware (@ponderware) March 16, 2021\n\nFoobar added that there’s a third option: Ponderware could raise enough money to front-run the bots themselves and store the cats in their wallet. Then the devs could give away the cats as they see fit. He added that due to a peculiarity in the MoonCats smart contract, the developers would have to raise about 500 ETH, or about $900,000.\n\nThe vote, which concludes tomorrow, will determine the fate of tokens currently worth $16 million in total. As of this writing, 718 of the 986 votes (72%) want to scrap the tokens. Whatever happens, Ponderware has a final gift—compensation for all the kerfuffle: the devs will airdrop five MoonCats, including 1 Genesis Cat, to five random voters.\n","read_this_next_post_id":62217,"read_this_next_post_type":"post","social_share_img_url":"https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/index-gID_4.jpg","featured_image_caption":"A collection of Foobar's rescued MoonCats.

Bitcoin was edging towards a new all-time high yesterday, it couldn’t keep the momentum going into today. The price of the world’s most popular cryptocurrency fell almost five percent in the last 24 hours, taking it to a price of $56,697. It still has a market cap of well over a trillion dollars, though.\n\nIt’s been a checkered week for Bitcoin. This time last week it was sitting at a high of $61.5k, bolstering the rest of the market with it. As per usual, most of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are down today. \n\nEthereum is down almost 4% to $1,768. For fans and investors it feels like a long time since it set a bullish looking ATH of $2000 a whole month ago. \n\nMeanwhile, overnight losses of around 7% were felt by holders of Cardano, Polkadot and Chainlink. Polkadot currently trades for $36.84 a coin, while Chainlink trades at $29.19. \n\nCardano is still technically pumping. Yesterday ADA reached a high of $1.31, but today it trades at $1.19. That’s still an almost 10% increase from last weekend. \n\nA QUIET WEEK FOR CRYPTO\n\nWhile mainstream interest in Bitcoin has certainly been flowering since it started its bull run over the course of the pandemic, this week brought relatively humble tidings to the coin.\n\nThe biggest news is that former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci’s hedge fund, SkyBridge, has filed for a Bitcoin ETF. It’s not its first Bitcoin investment product, either. Back in January, the Zoom launch call for its Bitcoin Fund crashed when over 6000 prospective investors tried to join at once. \n\nETFs are considered the holy grail of low-risk investment vehicles into cryptocurrencies. And since the resignation of former US Securities and Exchange Commission chair Jay Clayton, there has been hope of getting ETFs green lit in the US. \n\nAn ETF, or Exchange Traded Fund, is an auditable financial instrument that allows investors to buy into crypto while having the peace of mind that their money is going into a fully regulated investment vehicle, and not out into the unregulated wilderness of crypto. \n\nThree ETFs have already launched north of the border in Canada. The first was launched by Purpose, the second by Evolve and the third by CI Galaxy. Both Purpose and Evolve made it into the top 20 Canadian ETFs on the first day of launch. Purpose’s ETF even amassed $421 million in assets under management in the first two days. Trading has since cooled down for the Canadian ETFs.\n\nCRYPTO STILL HITS SOME ATHS\n\nOn Thursday, Bitcoin miners earned a record-setting $64 million in one day. That day, the market capitalization of the crypto economy hit $2 trillion, making Bitcoin the world’s third most valuable currency by market capitalization, according to Deutsche Bank.\n\nAnd if that wasn’t enough, NFT fever is still going strong over on the Ethereum network.

thespian and comedy writing legend John Cleese is the latest celebrity to mint an NFT. The auction for his ‘Brooklyn Bridge’ NFT, a landscape sketch which he drew on his iPad, is now live on NFT marketplace OpenSea, where a bid of $50,000 dollars has already been made by an eager collector named Cerwyn.\n\nCleese’s NFT could be poking fun at the fact that earlier this week, an NFT called ‘Bridge for sale’ was also listed for auction on OpenSea by its creator gcp-nyc. The NFT, currently worth $27, is a Google maps view of Brooklyn bridge, a reference to an American con artist George C. Parker, who was notorious for his often successful attempts conducting sales of New York landmarks like Madison Square Garden, the Statue of Liberty, and Brooklyn Bridge.\n\nIn a tweet yesterday afternoon UTC, the eighty-one-year-old Monty Python member John Cleese got in on the joke, announcing his own NFT and giving it a price:  “though bidding starts at 100.00, you can ‘BUY IT NOW’ for 69,346,250.50!”\n\n\u003e Hello! It is time you meet my alter ego \"Unnamed Artist\" I'm delighted to offer you the opportunity of a lifetime. I'm selling my 1st NFT. Though bidding starts at 100.00, you can “BUY IT NOW” for 69,346,250.50! https://t.co/Vuyx4trvPE pic.twitter.com/aC4oSVfGHF\n\u003e \n\u003e — John Cleese (@JohnCleese) March 19, 2021\n\nThe buy-it-now price is a not-so-subtle nod to Beeple’s magnum opus ‘EVERYDAYS: THE FIRST 5000 DAYS’. Beeple made an image every day for 5000 days and turned the whole collection into an NFT, which sold at auction via Christie’s for an unprecedented $69.3 million to NFT whale Metakovan.\n\nOther high-profile NFT creators have come out of the woodwork recently to collect huge sums for their digital art. \n\nOn March 1st, auctions concluded for electro-pop singer/songwriter and producer Grimes’s first foray into NFTs. Her debut collection of digital images netted her a sweet $6 million. \n\nSimilarly, _Rick \u0026 Morty_ creator Justin Roiland netted 1,300 ETH, worth about $1.65 million back in January, when his debut art collection sold through the online NFT auction house Nifty Gateway. \n\nWHAT’S THE BUZZ ABOUT NFTS?\n\nSince the advent of Ethereum, artists have been drawn to the NFT world as a way of selling their artwork digitally. How does it work? Thanks to Ethereum’s blockchain technology, which allows for the creation of smart contracts, artists can mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from their creative works.\n\nBecause of the fancy cryptographic nature of Ethereum’s distributed ledger, these NFTs are a form of verifiable digital scarcity. This means that if an artist creates a totally unique one-of-a-kind digital image, they can specify its uniqueness on the blockchain’s indelible distributed ledger. The sale of the unique NFT is then recorded on the ledger, transferring ownership of the one-of-a-kind NFT to its purchaser.\n\nHow To Make Your Own NFT and Get Crazy Rich\nAlthough traditional art acolytes may bemoan visual art’s increasing march into intangibility, there are certain material benefits that come with blockchain technology. Thanks to smart contracts, artists can even get an automatic commission on the future resale of their art, ensuring income long after the initial sale has been concluded.\n\nHOW DOES BASIL FAWLTY FIT INTO THIS?\n\nJohn Cleese’s decision to mint an NFT comes as bewildering news to crypto fans and classic British sitcom fans alike. In fact, his first foray into crypto art is also his first foray into art full stop. \n\nIn the tweet announcing the work, Cleese shared a promotional video where he makes several disingenuous and tongue-in-cheek remarks about crypto.\n\n“Hello, I’m not gonna tell you my name because all you need to know about me is that I’m a young unknown digital artist or a collective of artists,” he said, poking fun at the anonymity and pseudonymity that pervades the crypto community. He then turned the satire onto the language of crypto itself:\n\n“You and me we get it. Our parents laugh at non-refundable tokens and cryptic currencies. ‘It can’t go on the wall!’ they say. ‘Is the world ending?!’ No, hardly.”\n\nCleese also spoke with Vanity Fair about the auction, saying that “the world has gone terminally insane. This all reminds me of Henry David Thoreau, when he said, ‘Our inventions are wont to be pretty toys, which distract our attention from serious things. They are but improved means to an unimproved end.”\n\nSo Cleese is trolling the cryptoverse. \n\nWhat’s definitely not a joke, however, is that $50k offer. \n","read_this_next_post_id":62204,"read_this_next_post_type":"post","social_share_img_url":"https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shutterstock_1376951720-gID_4.jpg","featured_image_caption":"","featured_image_description":"John Cleese.
