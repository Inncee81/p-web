    When Was Online Dating Site Invented?
   </h2>
   <div class="hFPwlpWi1_B">
   </div>
   <p>
    When did dating evolve from “matchmaking” to “swipe-making”? Let’s do a quick run down history lane. If you find it easy to picture 1965, it makes this more fun. Online dating started in 1965 when two Harvard students created the first computer-based matchmaking service with an IBM 1404 computer in the United States.
   </p>
   <p>
    These two students created a 75 question survey for people in search of love. Love-hungry applicants would fill the questionnaire and mail it back to them with a service fee of $3. They received a computer-generated list of viable matches in return. In 1966 this little matchmaking company could boast of 90 000 users. In 1994, the first major online dating site was birthed, which was Kiss.com.
   </p>

    When Did Mobile Dating Apps Start Off?
   </h3>
   <p>
    After online dating started, it gradually developed to dating sites. More sites were developed, and years later, the first dating app was launched. Match.com started as a website; later, the app was launched in 1995. Match.com became the first online dating app and ushered in a new era of dating apps.

    With hundreds of thousands of dating sites out there, we trawled the internet for dating sites with proven track records. We analyzed the proven success rate of the plethora of online dating sites and apps and came up with a list of the best. You can be assured that the dating sites mentioned are tested and trusted. This list was compiled based on a couple of hands-on surveys, real-life reviews, and relationship expert opinions.

   <p>
    Specificity is highly important while picking out a dating site. Some sites were made specifically for hookups, and some sites are sworn to find your significant other. You will achieve nothing by signing up on a site for LGBT when you are straight” One feature that makes online dating easier is that you can streamline your options to people with similar interests. You have a plethora of niche-specific online dating websites to pick from, but first, you have to know the choices you have.

    Most Popular Dating Sites
   </h3>
   <p>
    Based on PCMags’s survey (involving 2000 people), Tinder is the most popular dating site followed by match.com. These two sites have been used by virtually everyone that has been initiated into the online dating world. Why are these sites so popular?
   </p>
   <p>
    Tinder got the crown for being the most popular dating site for a reason. Facebook login revealed that the tinder app was the most used. In 2018, it beat Spotify and candy crush saga as the most used app (that’s huge). Several online dating apps or sites try to keep up with Tinder, but most of them end up cloning the Tinder. Tinder offers singles readily available access to a plethora singles (are you still wondering why it is the most popular?)
   </p>
   <p>
    Recent research shows that match.com is quite popular in the US and might be a little more popular than Tinder in the United States. Why is match.com so popular? Being the first dating app ever, it has an extensive user base (more than the NYC population) and has recorded a lot of marriage testimonies since 1995.
   </p>
   <h3 class="PrnmcxH8gmK6">
    Hookup Sites
   </h3>
   <p>
    While some people are after the engagement rings, some are not looking forward to a serious relationship. Sometimes getting laid is the goal; there are hookup sites for people who belong to the hookup tribe. Get laid at no emotional cost whatsoever, except the cost of finding the perfect person to help you with that. Do you want a casual sex adventure with no strings attached, well, you are in luck, hookup culture is the new trend. There are boatloads of hookup sites, examples of hook up sites are AdultFriendFinder, iHookup, Pure, 99 Flavors, Zoosk, etc.
   </p>
   <h3 class="PrnmcxH8gmK6" id="christian-dating-sites">
    Christian Dating Sites
   </h3>
   <p>
    There are dating sites to foster Christian dating experience online. Online dating can get Christianly; just locate the right dating site. You can be sure you are getting matched with someone who shares the same belief with you. Gone are the days when Christians were limited to other members within the church or other well known Christians, Christian dating just got ”tech-spiced.” You can get a christ-centered relationship on Christ-centered dating sites, the good news is, you have more options. Examples of Christian dating sites are Christian connection, Christian Café, Christian Cupid, Christian Dating for Free, Christian Mingle, Cross path, etc.

    Elites Dating Sites
   </h3>
   <p>
    These dating sites are characterized by exclusivity and high class. Just like some people prefer quality to expediency. If you find it difficult to try fishing out a match of their level in a site with tons of people, the elite dating sites were launched, just for you. Dating could be an investment future and not just a ”fast food” for the present. The Troll for the ”classy singleton” fit for the investment should be done in a particular place. A list of the VIP elites dating sites have been compiled; it includes The League, Elites Single, Luxy, beLinked, etc.

    Gay and lesbian dating sites

Some dating sites for lesbians are Her, Scissr, Lesly, PinkCupid.

   <h3 class="PrnmcxH8gmK6">
    Free Dating sites
   </h3>
   <p>
    Although most dating sites have free registration, that’s the height of the freeness because the basic features require a premium membership. However, there are best free dating sites with free basic features; the payment required would be for an extension of some basic features or the crucial features. Some best free online dating sites are OkCupid, Hinge, Plenty of Fish, Tinder, Her, Happn, Hater, etc.
   </p>
   <h3 class="PrnmcxH8gmK6">
    Dating Apps: Free Apps vs. Best Ones
   </h3>
   <p>
    The price of an app doesn’t necessarily determine its quality. An app can be free and still be one of the best apps. Most times, it pays to look up the reviews of the app to determine the quality. One of the most popular apps which rank as one of the best dating apps(Tinder) is free. Asides Tinder, Bumble is also one of the best free dating sites, and these apps are still placed in comparison with Match.com despite the ultra-expensive subscription.
   </p>
   <p>
    Although even the free apps have some perks that need to be purchased, you will survive all right without payment.

    Staying Safe When Online Dating
   </h2>
   <p>
    Your online dating experience can rapidly switch from fun to dangerous without the necessary precautions. Safety comes second to nothing in the online dating world; you either stay safe or stay safe. Staying safe while trying to secure a perfect match is not as difficult as it seems. Any dating site without safety tips or a support team is suspicious. The best dating sites put the safety of their users first. Hence, they provide them with safety pro tips to follow religiously.
   </p>
   <p>
    Read all safety tips and report all suspicious users to the help or support team of the dating site or app. Some important safety tips are:
   </p>
   <h3 class="PrnmcxH8gmK6" id="avoid-divulging-your-personal-information">
    Avoid Divulging Your Personal Information
   </h3>
   <p>
    Information like your birth date, financial information, and address should be your personal top secret. Avoid answering questions related to that information while dealing with anyone you met on an online dating site. Sometimes, an anonymous zone is the safest zone to be. Avoid answering suspicious questions about yourself, report suspicious users to the site or app support team. Tell the person you are uncomfortable with the questions and refuse to answer. You can unmatch or walk away if it gets too uncomfortable.
   </p>
   <h3 class="PrnmcxH8gmK6" id="plan-to-meet-in-a-public-place">
    Plan to Meet in a Public Place
   </h3>
   <p>
    Not even an invitation to eat the best homemade lasagna should be enough to make you forget this. Inviting someone you just met to your home would be a grave mistake; going over to theirs would be like partying in a fire (getting roasted is almost inevitable). Meet a stranger in public places only, a coffee shop, a bar, or a restaurant (not exclusive booths).

    Inform Someone of Your Plans
   </h3>
   <p>
    The first meeting with an online date shouldn’t be personal. Make sure your friends or your family are aware. Give them details about the dates. Details like when, where, and with whom should be known to them. You can ask them to call you for a random checkup at a particular or agreed time.
   </p>
   <p>
    You can develop a code to communicate when you need help. The code can be telling your friend to feed your pet when you have none; this can send a message that you need help. You can’t be too careful.

   <h3 class="PrnmcxH8gmK6" id="dont-hesitate-to-leave">
    Don’t hesitate to leave
   </h3>
   <p>
    Once the conversation starts getting uncomfortable, leave. Don’t be afraid to leave once your safety is in question, and it doesn’t matter if you just finished an expensive meal. A stranger remains a stranger until he stops being one, you don’t owe a stranger any obligation, but you owe yourself your safety. Courtesy can be suspended when safety is in question.

    Take Care of Your Way to the Date
   </h3>
   <p>
    There will be time for the fairy tales that involves your date picking you up and treating you with respect. Before then, politely decline all offers to get picked up. Drive down to the venue or figure out a way to get yourself there and a way to get back. This will put you in control at all times; you can decide to leave once you feel less comfortable. That way, you will avoid being at the mercy of your date or getting stuck till the end of the dinner when you could have made a quick getaway earlier.

    How to have a successful first date
   </h2>
   <p>
    No one wants an awful first date, especially when the chemistry is strong; however, you need a little more than chemistry to secure a second one. According to relationship experts, there are a few strings you need to pull to ensure your first meeting goes perfectly well. They are:

    Steer clear of social media stalking
   </h3>
   <p>
    Based on research, 38% of people that met via online dating sites lookup their dates on social media before the first meeting. It’s tempting but avoid it totally, if you can. Social media research will help you form an opinion based on the online persona before you get a chance to meet the real person. Having a preconceived view of your date’s personality might not be very helpful while having a first date. It’s easy to form inaccurate assumptions through social media stalking, avoid it – totally!
   </p>
   <h3 class="PrnmcxH8gmK6">
    Go for Comfort
   </h3>
   <p>
    Making a first good impression matters a lot but not at the cost of your comfort. Don’t try hard to be someone you are not, maintain your personality, and dress comfortably. You don’t want discomfort to make your first date unbearable, so compare your options and choose comfort. Dress comfortably, but not shabbily, the first impression still matters, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.

    Add Some Confidence Exercises To Your Daily Routine
   </h3>
   <p>
    Meeting several people on dating websites can twitch and toy with your confidence. Take a few confidence exercises before meeting your partner; it’s normal to feel a little nervous, just picture a perfect night without any itch. You can picture coming back home with a smile on your face and fluttering butterflies in your belly. Thoughts like that will put you at ease. Keep the confidence intact throughout the date; let the conversation flow freely. You can stand in front of a mirror and tell yourself, ”I am bold! I am confident! I can do this!”. This may sound bizarre, but it works like a charm.

   <h3 class="PrnmcxH8gmK6" id="the-more-joy-the-better">
    The More Joy, The Better
   </h3>
   <p>
    Free yourself and relieve your self of all tensions by laughing to a joke or sharing a funny one. Laughter helps your body release endorphins that make you relax. Try laughing when you should and lighten the atmosphere; you will break through the tensed surface and bond better. Avoid sharing dry jokes; if you don’t have a joke, don’t try to share one.
   </p>
   <h3 class="PrnmcxH8gmK6" id="show-your-interest-with-your-body">
    Show Your Interest With Your Body
   </h3>
   <p>
    Have you ever heard ”actions speak louder than words”? Your body language is loud; make sure it’s saying the right thing! Avoid passing the wrong message across with your body language. Crossing your hands and legs suggests you are closed or unresponsive, I doubt you want to send that kind of message across on your first date (except you have stopped being interested). Send an open body language and don’t compare your right hand with your left by looking down throughout, make eye contact! Frequent and direct eye contact screams confidence and interest.
   </p>
   <h3 class="PrnmcxH8gmK6" id="be-attentive">
    Be Attentive
   </h3>
   <p>
    Paying rapt attention to someone shows the person, or whatever the person is saying is important. Everyone loves undivided attention. Staring off into space or looking over someone’s shoulders could be insulting. Put all your effort into being actively involved in every conversation during your date. Your phone can always wait, avoid texting unless it’s highly important.
   </p>
   <h3 class="PrnmcxH8gmK6" id="pay-attention">
    Pay Attention
   </h3>
   <p>
    Active involvement in your date includes asking questions. Asking questions shows you are paying attention, it also sends a message that you are interested in. The essence of a first date is getting to know each other better. Asking questions will help you achieve that. Inquire about things that are important to your partner, ask about his/her dreams and passions. Avoid boring topics like global warming (except you both share interests in that field).
   </p>
   <h3 class="PrnmcxH8gmK6" id="an-aura-of-positivity-is-important">
    An Aura of Positivity Is Important
   </h3>
   <p>
    A genuine smile can brighten an ”atmosphere,” one perfect way to stay positive is by smiling. Once you have a positive attitude, your date will be a success. Being positive also makes the other person feel good.
   </p>
   <h3 class="PrnmcxH8gmK6" id="pay-for-oneself">
    Pay for oneself
   </h3>
   <p>
    This comes up as an argument frequently. The person who initiated the date should be responsible for the bill, but it’s easier just to split the bill. However, if your date insists, don’t drag it or compare purses just politely accept the offer graciously.
   </p>
   <h3 class="PrnmcxH8gmK6" id="follow-up">
    Follow up
   </h3>
   <p>
    A lot has changed about dating; even online dating keeps changing. After a date, don’t wait for days before calling your partner. Proving you are not eager to get across might send a wrong message now. After an exciting first meeting, call or send a quick message to let your partner know it was fun, and you would like to do it again soon.

    Spam Alert
   </h2>
   <p>
    It’s not rare to come across bots on dating websites. Spammers use bots to lure victims on several online dating platforms. A chatbot is a chat that makes a real conversation with a user by acting like a human. Different dating sites have had their own experiences with bots, and they are finding a way to eradicate spammers and bots. Some developers are not making attempts to get fake profiles and bots off their websites. There are tips to help you recognize scammers or bots when they chat you up; the tips are as follows:
   </p>
   <ul class="bmqz1fW0f">
    <li>
     They demand money
    </li>
    <li>
     They avoid meeting up personally
    </li>
    <li>
     They don’t make phone calls, they never agree to a video call neither do they take pictures
    </li>
    <li>
     They make you feel loved and come on strong
    </li>
    <li>
     They demand a switch to email
    </li>
    <li>
     They often seem unreal and too good
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   <p>
    While exploring these sites, you need to ensure you are not communicating with bots. There are ways to avoid getting scammed by scammers and bots; they are:
   </p>
   <ul class="bmqz1fW0f">
    <li>
     Calm down and explain suspicious conversations or actions to someone you trust
    </li>
    <li>
     Don’t send money, gifts, or anything to someone you met on an online dating site because you won’t get it back.
    </li>
    <li>
     Once you suspect you have sent money to a scammer, contact your bank.
    </li>
    <li>
     Report your experience and the account to the site’s support team. Report to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
    </li>
   </ul>

    What’s an Expert Opinion?
   </h2>
   <p>
    Dating sites have come to stay; there is no doubt about that. Experts claim that 30% of US adults asserted they had used online dating sites. The attitude of the public to online dating is quite positive, and it has become the first choice of many. The social role and social interaction are gradually becoming ”mechanized.” Although dating sites can’t replace previous dating means, it will soon become the primary means of dating. Matches have led to meetups, and finally, to marriages, the potency of these sites and apps cannot be overlooked. However, there are so many out there that knowing the best dating sites will go a long way in helping you stay safe and in the dating business. In the end, regardless of dating means, your satisfaction is all that matters.
