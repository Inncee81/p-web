           The restaurant chain announced the tragic news in a Facebook post, saying Kent Taylor died on Thursday after experiencing from severe post-coronavirus symptoms, including tinnitus. 'Kent battled and fought hard like the former track champion that he was, but the suffering that greatly intensified in recent days became unbearable,' Taylor's family said in a statement. Taylor founded Texas Roadhouse in 1993 after coming up with the idea on a cocktail napkin. The first location opened in Louisville, Kentucky, where the company is based. Today, it boasts 630 restaurants in 49 states and 10 countries. Taylor held various roles at the company, serving as chief executive and chairman of the board until his death. Last spring he made headlines when he gave up his salary to help support frontline workers during the pandemic.

             Donald Trump will return to social media in the next few months with a platform of his own, longtime advisor Jason Miller revealed Sunday. 'I do think that we're going to see President Trump returning to social media in probably about two or three months here with his own platform – and this is something that I think will be the hottest ticket in social media,' Miller said during an interview with Fox News 'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz on Sunday morning. He added that the new platform will 'completely redefine the game' of social media. Miller, a principal at SHW Partners and spokesperson for Trump's 2020 reelection campaign, predicted the former president will attract 'tens of millions' of new users to his online presence.

            Joe Biden's Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas sent a clear message to migrants on Sunday: The U.S. border is closed. 'Our message has been straightforward and simple, and it's true - The border is closed. We are expelling families. We are expelling single adults,' Mayorkas told NBC's 'Meet the Press' on Sunday morning. 'I think we are executing on our plans and, quite frankly, when we are finished doing so, the American public will look back on this and say we secured our border and we upheld our values and our principles as a nation,' he added.

            The male migrant, who was not named, made his alarming prediction on Friday in El Paso, Texas, after being apprehended by Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Asked if he believes more migrants will come to the US under the Biden administration, he said with a shrug: 'It's not going to stop, ever. It's not going to stop.' The comments came after records revealed that the CBP apprehended more than 100,000 migrants at the border in February, compared to just 16,182 in April 2020 when migration slowed drastically amid the coronavirus pandemic.

            Christine Davitt, left, a senior social media manager at Teen Vogue, wrote two tweets in 2009 using the N-word. She recently criticized Alexi McCammond, right, for past racist tweets regarding Asian Americans. After news of her tweets became public, Davitt's Twitter account was switched from public to private. McCammond, 27, lost the top editing job at Teen Vogue even before she was able to assume the new role after staff members complained about racist comments she posted when she was a teenager.

            The court conflict between Estee Lauder chairman William Lauder, 60, and socialite Taylor Stein, 54, was laid bare in a New York Post article published Saturday. Lauder is reportedly asking the Los Angeles Superior Court to kick Stein out of the $7million, 6,000-square-foot Bel Air mansion he purchased for her. He is also trying to terminate a 2007 settlement agreement under which he promised to pay Stein $1million a year to keep the identity of their love child shrouded in secrecy. Lauder claims that Stein violated the agreement when their daughter allegedly described her parents as being 'divorced' in a social media post last December.

            Spring breakers invading Miami Beach have become so uncontrollable that authorities imposed a curfew on Saturday and declared a state of emergency as SWAT teams were seen moving in to clear people out. A SWAT vehicle was filmed moving down Ocean Drive - a popular party street - and using an LRAD, also known as a sound cannon, to get people to disperse, video posted to Twitter shows. The move to control the crowds followed weeks of wild partying in Miami Beach, which is no stranger to uncontrollable spring break throngs of young people. But this year the volume is clearly higher than in previous years, said Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber, who's expressed concern about the lack of coronavirus restrictions - like wearing a mask - in Florida. 'I think it is in part due to the fact that there are very few places open elsewhere in the country, or they're too cold, or they're not open and they're too cold,' he said. The crowds of young people crushing the beach city have sparked worries of a coronavirus 'super-spreader' event, while alcohol-fueled partiers have been starting fights in restaurants and in the streets, officials said.

            Republican Julia Letlow sailed to victory Saturday in a House special election for Louisiana's 5th District, taking the seat her husband Luke won but did not fill due to his death from coronavirus in December. The win came after former President Donald Trump sent an endorsement Saturday morning of Letlow. Letlow will make history as the first-ever Republican congresswoman from Louisiana - and only the third woman ever elected to Congress from that state.

            An anonymous Russian intelligence officer who warned UK novichok victim Sergei Skripal was being targeted by the Kremlin has spoken out to warn dissidents they are on the 'kill list'. The six anti-Putin opponents who are living in Britain include businessman Bill Browder and former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, whose dodgy Trump dossier made him a household name. Russia's relations with Western governments are at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War, marred by allegations of election interference and sweeping cyberattacks. Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week described Moscow as an 'active threat' to British and European security, and vowed to raise the cap on the number of nuclear weapons in response. Joe Biden refused to apologize after calling the Russian leader a 'killer' amid an escalating war of words between the two countries. President Putin snapped back by wishing his American counterpart 'good health' and recalling the Russian Ambassador from the United States.

            A Pittsburgh area police detective who is also a member of an FBI task force filed for divorce from his wife after she was photographed with another man while allegedly taking part in the MAGA riot at the US Capitol on January 6. Jennifer Heinl (seen in the undated file photo on the left alongside a man identified by the FBI as Kenneth Grayson of Bridgeville, Pennsylvania), 55, of Ross Township, Pennsylvania was arrested on Thursday and charged with a number of federal crimes, including violent entry and disorderly conduct. Heinl is the wife of Michael Heinl (bottom left inset), a highly regarded detective with the Shaler Township Police Department. Federal investigators allege that Heinl was pictured in surveillance footage speaking to another man, Grayson, inside the Capitol Rotunda during the chaos on January 6 (bottom right). The image on the top right shows a woman alleged to be Heinl outside the Capitol on January 6. The FBI alleges that Heinl and Grayson, a resident of nearby Bridgeville, Pennsylvania, were communicating via Facebook beginning in November. During those alleged discussions, they spoke of plans to travel to Washington, DC as well as arrangements for hotel accommodations and rental vehicles.

            Nüwa, the capital city and one of five designed, is built vertically instead of horizontally into the side of a cliff, which would diminish the effect of atmospheric pressure and radiation. Fortunately, carbon dioxide and water can be had on the surface of Mars, which is what ABIBOO wants to use to help create steel and build exclusive from materials on the planet. The city would still include all of the mainstays of a city on Earth, including homes, offices, and green spaces. Designs for the space are based on scientific research from The Mars Society and the SONet network.

            Prince Harry's claims that his brother is 'trapped' inside the system of the British monarchy are 'way off the mark', a source close to the royal family has reportedly said. Instead, Prince William (pictured left), who is second in line to the throne behind his father, has 'accepted' his role and 'the path set for him'. He is very much his grandmother's grandson in that respect of duty and service,' a source close to both brothers told the Sunday Times. It comes after Prince Harry (pictured inset with wife Meghan Markle and William and Kate) sensationally claimed his brother and his father, Prince Charles, are 'trapped' in the system of the British monarchy. Prince Harry made the claim during he and wife Meghan Markle's bombshell interview (pictured right) with Oprah Winfrey earlier this month.

            The Spanish capital bucked the trend by easing Covid restrictions and its bars and restaurants have been opened since late last year. The region also decided to push back the curfew adopted by Spain (10pm-6am) to 11pm. While in other areas of Spain, terraces of bars and restaurants can be up to 100 per cent capacity until 6pm, in Madrid they stay open until 11pm. Spanish officials also wanted to put in place travel restrictions between regions across the country but Madrid has refused.

            Kylie Jenner has generated a minor controversy after donating what her fans considered to be an insufficient amount to a Go Fund Me campaign. The online campaign is soliciting donations for Samuel Rauda, a makeup artist who underwent emergency surgery after sustaining multiple injuries in a recent car accident; he previously worked with the influencer as her stylist. Many of the 23-year-old reality television personality's fans were quick to notice that she had only donated $5,000 to her friend's medical fund, and took to their social media outlets, particularly Twitter, to voice their disapproval of Jenner's donation.

             While we've all been told time and time again that eight hours is the optimal number for sleep, one Australian expert claims that there is no 'magic number' that suits all.

            Novelist Phillip Roth could face getting canceled after his biographers posthumously revealed allegations from his life reflecting misogyny seen in his books. The Pulitzer Prize-winning author, who died in 2018, was known for penning novels throughout the 20th Century filled with 'enormous rage and disappointment with womenkind,' as described by literary scholar Mary Allen in 1976. After his death in 2018, critics surmised that that Roth would face a reckoning for his portrayal of women and Jews in his work.

            Rachel Uchitel, whose affair with Tiger Woods went public during his infamous 2009 cheating scandal, may have a new man in her life -- or just a close male friend. On Saturday, the media personality hit the streets of Manhattan for a couple of walks, which eventually included a hookup and PDA display with a mystery man on both occasions. The pair proceeded to pack on their public displays of affection as they strolled along -- walking arm in arm and making the occasional stop to gaze into each other's eyes and share a hug.

            Swathes of mice (left) are infesting towns in New South Wales (NSW) and southern Queensland in Australia after the country was hit with heavy summer rains following years of drought. One resident, Lisa Gore, from Toowoomba, said her friend had found a nest of baby mice in her armchair while shopkeeper Naav Singh said he was now arriving to his store five hours before opening to clean up after the mice and sweep their droppings. This month Melanie Moeris, from Gilgandra, also shared images of hundreds of mice scurrying over machinery on her family's farm in Gilgandra (top and bottom right). The shocking scenes come after three hospital patients were bitten by the creatures at facilities in Tottenham, Walgett and Gulargambone, NSW Health confirmed.

            The October 7, 1966, crash (left) in Newport, Rhode Island that killed Eduardo Tirella (bottom right) and involved the heiress, daughter of American Tobacco Company founder James Duke, is covered in Peter Lance's new book Homicide at Rough Point.' 'Absolutely she intended to kill him,' Lance, who grew up in Newport and worked as a journalist there, said. Lance claims that local police chief Joseph Radice was behind the cover-up to get Duke (top right) off the hook, ultimately getting the case dismissed.

            Donald Trump's personal Boeing 757 is corroding and missing parts of an engine as it sits idle on a fenced-off tarmac at a small upstate New York airport. The gold-plated plane - which was once nicknamed 'Trump Force One' - has not been flown for months and is languishing at the regional Stewart Airport, new photos reveal.  One of the aging plane's engines is missing parts, while the other is 'shrink-wrapped in plastic', according to CNN.

            On Wednesday, the US Attorney's Office for the Western District of New York announced that it was launching a civil action to determine ownership of the luxury Italian car. Last year, Customs and Border Protection officials received petitions from Italian resident Paolo Provenzi (top) and Mohammad Alsaloussi (bottom) in Miami. Provenzi was the owner of the Ferrari when it was stolen on March 30, 2003, in Imola, Italy, from a parking garage at the Hotel Donatello. Lawyers representing Mohammed Alsaloussi and car collector Ikonick Collections submitted their petition for the car as well.

            More wild weather is for the way for rain-soaked New South Wales residents as a once-in-a-century deluge continues to lash the east coast. Conditions are dangerous and volatile as more flood warnings were issued for parts of western Sydney and the NSW mid north coast on Sunday night. Flood waters in Sydney's west and north-west are now higher than the catastrophic 1961 flood, with residents of parts of Penrith told to leave their homes by 9pm. A severe weather remains in place for much of the NSW coast that could lead to flash of life-threatening flooding with dozens of school closed and staff urged to work from home on Monday.

            A 20-foot-long US Air Force drone briefly caused a scare in Florida on Friday after washing ashore at a local beach. The massive orange drone, which are used as aerial targets for fighter pilots, was discovered by a passerby at Ocean Hammond Park near Boynton Beach, authorities said. Ocean Ridge Police officers were called to the scene after bystanders feared the aircraft could have been a missile or a bomb.
