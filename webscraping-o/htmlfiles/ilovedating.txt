    A lot of people testify to meeting their soul mates and partners with online dating. The internet has, no doubt, played a huge part in our social lives and relationships. However, of course, all of these dating sites aren’t equal, and here are some of the best dating sites:
   </p>
   <ul class="FOuTkXyMTQQ1">
    <li>
     <b>
      Tinder
     </b>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   <p>
    Tinder is a great place to find whatever you’re looking for, from serious relationships to hookups to friendships. Plus, it also does not exclude the LGBTQ community. Profiles are kept short, and this has its pros and cons. The downside is that you will only know only a little about a person. On the bright side, you get to decide quickly if you will go for a person or not.
   </p>
   <ul class="FOuTkXyMTQQ1">
    <li>
     <b>
      Her
     </b>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   <p>
    This app is one of the LGBTQ dating apps, essentially for lesbian, queer or bisexual women, and one of the few good ones out there. Even though it does have its downsides, it is much better than a whole lot of other LGBTQ dating apps.
   </p>
   <ul class="FOuTkXyMTQQ1">
    <li>
     <b>
      OK Cupid
     </b>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   <p>
    One of the best things about OkCupid is how in-depth their profiles are. This way, you get to know someone to some extent before making a move, without feeling like you have to make decisions based mostly on photos. To help reduce the number of offensive texts and fake profiles, OkCupid stuck to letting members only send messages to matches.
   </p>
   <ul class="FOuTkXyMTQQ1">
    <li>
     <b>
      Match.com
     </b>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   <p>
    With over three million users, Match continues to wax strong. Its free membership and inclusivity make it one of the best free online dating sites, among many others. Profiles here are quite detailed, and you can even control who sends you a message with a feature called the “Zen mode.” There’s a free and paid membership with different awesome features.

    The History of Online Dating?
   </h2>
   <p>
    Dating has continued to evolve over the years. At first, it used to be first dates through to proposals or betrothment. Next, it moved to last for a long while before marriage. However, this concept has gone through a range of processes that have finally brought us to online dating.
   </p>
   <p>
    This started from having personal ads on newspapers with the intent of hooking up or finding love. Not long after, the coming of the internet took these ads to the digital world. The first online dating site was introduced in the year 1959. It was developed by Phil Fialer and Jim Harvey, both Stanford students, during a class project. They used a mainframe computer and a punch card questionnaire and were able to match at least forty-nine people. It was never commercialized, but it was the very first attempt.
   </p>
   <p>
    Several other online dating methods were introduced until the year 2000, when Eharmony, officially the first dating site, came to be. This site was launched by Dr. Neil Clark Warren, and it helped people find serious relationships by using questionnaires.
   </p>
   <h3 class="zqMPVsk" id="when-did-mobile-dating-apps-come-on-the-scene">
    When Did Mobile Dating Apps Come on the Scene?
   </h3>
   <p>
    Mobile dating apps are thought to have stemmed up initially from the gay community. This is because the LGBTQ community has always had a tough time finding love or hookups. After all, they never know who is out to take advantage of them and embarrass them, or who is also gay.
   </p>
   <p>
    The first gay dating apps were Scruff and Grindr, which made dating for gay people much easier. They were introduced in the year 2010 and 2009, respectively. Then Tinder came to be later in the year 2012, which allowed people of all sexualities to participate in the online dating scene via dating apps. Tinder very easily became one of the most popular dating apps and became even more popular when its operations finally included Android users. Many other dating apps came up after this.

    With the rise of online dating sites and apps, it has become increasingly difficult to tell legit dating sites, from the bad ones and the ones that end up being a scam. There are roughly eight thousand dating websites in existence currently, along with thousands of reviews of each.
   </p>
   <p>
    Here are a few things that will help you identify the best online dating sites and dating apps.
   </p>
   <ul class="FOuTkXyMTQQ1">
    <li>
     <b>
      Privacy
     </b>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   <p>
    One of the first things to consider in deciding if an online dating site or app is good enough is how serious they take the privacy of their users. Users will use platforms they trust, and a platform that is not trustworthy is not worth any good. Good dating sites also have provisions for complaints in case of cyber harassment.
   </p>
   <ul class="FOuTkXyMTQQ1">
    <li>
     <b>
      Profile Creation Processes
     </b>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   <p>
    A great dating site should make sure that its profile creation process isn’t bulky, yet it should be detailed enough to help users make decisions and know others before sending messages. It should give users a chance to personalize profiles the way they love.
   </p>
   <ul class="FOuTkXyMTQQ1">
    <li>
     <b>
      Localization
     </b>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   <p>
    People sometimes want to be able to find people in their state, city, or neighborhood without having to look too far. Not many people enjoy long-distance relationships or the stress of going far away to meet people. People love comfort, and great online dating sites and apps know this, so they offer comfort.
   </p>
   <ul class="FOuTkXyMTQQ1">
    <li>
     <b>
      Compatibility Checker
     </b>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   <p>
    No one wants to have to go through hundreds of profiles to find one person. The best online dating sites help this situation with compatibility checkers that match users according to interests, sexual preferences, location, etc. Regular suggestions are also a key feature.
   </p>
   <ul class="FOuTkXyMTQQ1">
    <li>
     <b>
      Communication
     </b>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   <p>
    Communication should not be mitigated on dating sites, except for reasonable purposes like security. The best dating apps and sites, therefore, encourage communication with video calls, personal messaging, chat rooms, etc. Everyone who signs up to a dating site plans to communicate with potential dates; it’s a no-brainer that the best dating sites make this possible.

   <br/>
   <p>
    Matchmaking sites take on the responsibility of saving you the time and the stress it takes to go through multiple profiles. They provide matches for their users according to their needs, preferences, interests, and other details provided by the user.
   </p>

    <li>
     <b>
      Event Sites

   <br/>
   <p>
    This is for individuals who love to meet people in group settings. After becoming a member of any of these event dating sites, you get to attend their parties and gatherings and meet up with potential partners or matches. You could also lookup profiles of people you have found interesting from the gatherings and maybe set up a date with them.

    <li>
     <b>
      Preference Sites

    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   <p>
    These are dating sites that cater specifically to your preferences. These preferences could include religious, ethnic, sexuality, and personality preferences. If you have preferences, then you want to check out these types of dating websites. You should go to sites with higher traffic for better results.

    <li>
     <b>
      Tinder
     </b>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <br/>
   <p>
    Tinder has something for everyone, with millions of users to choose from. It even has a free version, so no one is left out of the fun. It is fast and pretty easy to get laid on Tinder. There are paid memberships; Tinder Gold and Tinder Plus, which come with even better features.

One of the rules on Pure is that all users must pretend like they are strangers after a hookup, to keep the ”no strings attached” rules; this makes Pure a fire hookup site.

    <li>

      iHookup

    </li>

   <br/>
   <p>
    Even though iHookup is a hookup site, it ensures that its users put some effort into creating good profiles and posting good photos of their faces too. This way, your feed doesn’t have to look like a porn site all the time. iHookup does not have such a large user base yet, so its users are geographically more spread out. This makes it useful for sexting with someone on the other side of the world.

   </p>
   <h3 class="zqMPVsk" id="meet-only-in-public-spaces">
    Meet Only in Public Spaces
   </h3>

    Of course, not everyone is a creep, but you don’t want to wait to find out, right? It’s wiser to keep your meetings strictly in public and open spaces where there are people. Avoid meeting in lonely or secluded areas.
   </p>
   <h3 class="zqMPVsk" id="inform-at-least-one-friend">
    Inform at Least One Friend
   </h3>

   </p>
   <h3 class="zqMPVsk" id="dont-hesitate-to-leave-when-you-need">
    Don’t Hesitate to Leave When You Need

   </p>
   <h3 class="zqMPVsk" id="meet-at-the-agreed-spot-and-go-home-yourself">
    Meet at the Agreed Spot and Go home yourself
   </h3>

    Keep Your Comfort in Mind

    The last thing you want is to make yourself uncomfortable for a date. This means that you should wear something that makes a good impression, without having to hold your breath.

    Body Language is Important

   </p>
   <h3 class="zqMPVsk" id="pay-attention">
    Pay Attention
   </h3>

   </p>
   <h3 class="zqMPVsk" id="dont-be-afraid-to-ask-questions">
    Don’t be Afraid to Ask Questions
   </h3>
   <p>
    Your date wants to know that you’re interested in them, and if you do want your date to be happy, then ask them questions. You could ask about their dreams, family, hobbies, or interests. You could even ask about favorite songs or movies.
   </p>
   <h3 class="zqMPVsk" id="stay-positive">
    Stay Positive
   </h3>

    Do not Let Them Pay the Bill Alone

   <h3 class="zqMPVsk" id="follow-up">
    Follow Up
   </h3>
