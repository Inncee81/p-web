            "articleBody": "Note: This is a guest post from Denaye Barahona of&nbsp;Simple Families. When I was pregnant with my first child, I had big ideas. I wanted to give my children the world. Like most new parents, I had the best of intentions. Every generation wants to give their children more than they had themselves. My intention was no different&mdash;I wanted to give my children more. More love. More protection. More opportunities. More toys. More, more, more. This desire for more was rooted in love. After I had children and they began to grow, there was a shift. This desire for more became rooted in fear. If I didn&rsquo;t play with them enough, would they be happy? If I didn&rsquo;t stand at least two feet from them at all times on the playground, would they fall? If I didn&rsquo;t land a spot in a top preschool, would their education be impacted? In the words of Erin Loechner, &ldquo;No one ever told me how much fear is hidden in love.&rdquo; All this fear, camouflaged as love, quickly started to take a toll on me. Trying to be everything and do everything for my children left me depleted. My desire to give my children more left me feeling less. Less energy. Less joy. Less calm. Then I found Minimalism. Minimalism is more than just getting rid of all your stuff (although I am on that bandwagon too). It&rsquo;s about filtering out the noise to focus your energy on what&rsquo;s important. Families of today have noisy lives. I know this in my personal life, but also in my professional life. I have a Ph.D. in Child Development with a specialty in Family Wellness. I work with families to find calm amongst the noise. In families, the calm lies in balancing the needs of each individual while simultaneously tightening the strings that hold them all together. Sounds tricky, right? How to Parent Like a Minimalist. Fortunately minimalism has a secret formula for parents: Less is More. Here are some lessons I&rsquo;ve learned on my journey toward a simpler family life: 1. Hover less and your children will live more. We spend so much time protecting our children, we forget to let them live. When we hover over them and perseverate over safety, our fears can undermine a child&rsquo;s confidence. These fears rob them of their independence. Instead of hovering, let&rsquo;s instill a sense of responsibility and natural curiosity for the world. Allow your children to live life to the fullest. Even if that means climbing to the top of the jungle gym without a spotter. 2. Entertain less and your children will innovate more. In many ways, Pinterest is a trap. The abundance of art, craft, and activity ideas that abound leave us feeling as though we need to do more to entertain our kids. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be easy if we could just flip a switch and provide unlimited entertainment for our kids? Oh wait, we can. We can limit screen time for our kids. When we provide endless varieties of entertainment for our children, we leave them with very little opportunity to create and explore new ideas on their own. So hear me out: Follow my lead and skip the Pinterest activities. Then cut back on the screen time. Let kids be bored. Give them space. The innovation that results will astound you. 3. Schedule less and your children will rest more. As humans, we need to rest our bodies and minds. This is particularly true of small bodies that are growing and maturing rapidly. Research show us that childhood anxiety is a rising epidemic in this generation. A child who grows up with anxiety is significantly more likely to be plagued with mental health challenges throughout their adult years. Do you know what our children need? Rest. Do you know what we need? Rest. Stop making rest a luxury&mdash;make rest a priority. The mental and physical health of your family depends on it. 4. Referee less and your children will problem solve more. As parents, we wear many hats. One hat we need to hang up is that of the referee. Parents have the tendency to jump in and solve any disputes and challenges that children come across. It&rsquo;s easier to be the referee than watch two kids awkwardly settle their own disagreement. It&rsquo;s easier to be jump in and help, than wait ten minutes for a kid to fumble through shoe tying. After you hang up that hat, get comfortable sitting on the sidelines in silence. Kids need a lot of practice to learn how to problem solve&mdash;so let&rsquo;s give them many chances to do it for themselves. 5. Buy less and your children will seek more. Research shows that clutter is associated with higher levels of stress in families. Have you yelled at your kids to clean up their rooms recently? If your home has less inside, it is easier to clean up. It is easier to take good care of fewer things. You know what doesn&rsquo;t have a long-term impact on a child happiness? The latest hit toy. Buy your children less, and as a result, they will be able to better filter out the noise and focus on the important things. Studies tell us that family vacations and togetherness have a long term impact on a child&rsquo;s happiness. Let&rsquo;s teach our children to value &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; less and experiences more. What are you doing less of to help your kids get more out of life? *** Denaye Barahona Ph.D. is a mother of two and the founder of Simple Families, a podcast and community for families interested in minimalism with kids, family wellness, and positive parenting.

            "articleBody": "Note: This is a guest post from&nbsp;Lisa Avellan of Simple and Soul. As minimalists, we strive for less stuff to experience more life. We learn how to detach from our possessions, limit technology, set boundaries with our commitments, and manage our finances with more intention. Our schedules get pared down to the most important appointments, we open our calendars for family time, meeting with a friend, reading, or pursuing a passion. Simplicity becomes our goal. We learn to ask ourselves important questions before adding any item to our life: &ldquo;How can this make my life easier?&rdquo;&ldquo;Will this cause more freedom or hold me back?&rdquo; Simplicity takes more intention than renting a storage unit, so we learn to value the weight of every decision. The value of an item or experience becomes more than a price tag or a great story to tell at a cocktail party. Minimalism is not for the half-hearted. Minimalism is a journey of heart and soul. It&rsquo;s a deep dive into the core of what we believe about who we are, where we find value, our purpose, and our passion. These are incredibly personal and difficult mountains to climb. A compass and hatchet are necessary tools to make the journey. This matter of the heart requires that we take great care to cut the nonessentials, and cultivate the things we should never minimize. It&rsquo;s how we maximize the benefits of minimalism. Here are nine things that should never fall victim to our minimalist pursuit: 1. Relationships We should never commit so intently to this outlier way of life that we alienate our family, faithful friends, or the potential new positive relationships. There may be a time when minimizing harmful or unhealthy relationships is appropriate, however minimalism isn&rsquo;t about living a reclusive or withdrawn existence. We minimize to un-clutter our lives from that which robs our time and energy from investing in the most important people in our lives. 2. Community Living with less should never mean less community. In fact, living with less opens our lives to more community and opportunity to live alongside others, minimalist or not. Our community, those outside our immediate family but who share in our activities around home, school, work, church, or neighborhood, should benefit from our life of less. The amount of time we gain, the items that can be reused or repurposed by someone in need, and the hospitality we offer in less crowded homes are practical ways to intentionally live in community. 3. Gratitude I believe that the greatest expression of gratitude is minimalism. When one is truly grateful for what matters most, no amount of possessions could change that contentment. A room full of gadgets and toys or forgotten impulse purchases steals our gratitude by complicating our lives. To live a life of gratitude, we recognize that the essentials are enough and we can experience how they enhance our existence. Gratitude isn&rsquo;t being thankful for what you have; it&rsquo;s believing what you have is enough. 4. Empathy We don&rsquo;t like to admit it, but when we have a strong belief about the way we live, sometimes we minimize our empathy for those who live differently. Becoming minimalist is never a destination; it&rsquo;s a journey of minimizing the outside influences. But non-minimalists are not outsiders, they are people. They are potential inspiring mentors, faithful leaders, guides, and peacemakers. The way we treat others who struggle with the burden of stuff will either maximize their value to us or minimize our value to them. Choose wisely. 5. Generosity Minimalism is not an excuse to not be generous. It is the greatest excuse to be more generous. Ridding our lives of excess offers the obvious opportunity to donate or re-home our possessions that can be useful to someone. But there are other not so obvious reasons we should never minimize generosity: we create more space to offer our home, time, meals, service, and gifts to others. Our unburdened schedules allow more investments in relationships, more family building, and more financial resources. Our minds are free of stressors so we can create more and share more of our talents. Need less, give more. 6. Education I spoke with a middle aged woman recently who is, in her words, pursuing a &ldquo;useless&rdquo; graduate degree. I felt sad that she perceived her educational pursuit was for nothing. Education in any form, when applied, enriches our lives to greater understanding, empathy, and action. To minimize our education is to minimize our potential to change the world. For any educational investment, we gain, at the very least, a deepened capacity to think and to relate to the world bustling around us. 7. Dreams Our passions and dreams often end up on the chopping block when we are overwhelmed with crammed calendars and suffocated by our stuff. Minimalism should never stifle the life-giving joys in our life. When we release our attachment to stuff and busyness, we have more time and energy to pursue and participate in our passions. If we ever feel the need to minimize the very thing that makes us come alive, we&rsquo;ve lost sight of who we are. Minimalism creates space for the development of our dreams and passions and we then realize the burden our stuff has over us. 8. Forgiveness If you&rsquo;ve ever been in any kind of relationship that has lasted more than a few days, you know that forgiveness is part of life. If we minimize our capacity to forgive, we can never hope to grow or change. Significant relationship demands repentance and forgiveness. Ruth Bell Graham said, &ldquo;Marriage is a union of two good forgivers.&rdquo; I believe that&rsquo;s true of any relationship. Minimizing the value of forgiveness will kill our capacity for genuine connection. 9. Joy The absence of joy is often caused by our inaccurate source of value. The more we buy the less happy we are. It may seem depressing to live a life with less, but that&rsquo;s only because we haven&rsquo;t freed ourselves from the chains of believing our value comes from what we own. Less stuff is more joy. To free ourselves from comparisons and the joy-killing value system of a broken world, the answer lies in the freedom of minimalism. How are you maximizing the benefits of minimalism? &mdash; Lisa Avellan writes at&nbsp;Simple &amp; Soul, helping you simplify life so you can uncover your soul and live joyfully just as you are.

            "articleBody": "The first time I ever heard about it was from the family practice doctor in Wisconsin who delivered my son, Salem. The doctor&mdash;old enough to be my father&mdash;became a man I grew to love and appreciate and would soon call friend. He once told me that he ate a taco salad every day for lunch. The next time I encountered the phenomenon, a few years later, was with a friend at his parents&rsquo; house. He walked me into their basement pantry loaded with shelves of canned tuna&mdash;solid white albacore. He told me that his dad, a professional fisherman, ate a tuna fish sandwich every day for lunch. Two men, both well respected in the community, ate the same lunch every single day. I didn&rsquo;t give the idea much thought after that, other than occasionally being jealous that my doctor friend got to eat a taco salad every day for lunch.&nbsp;Mmm. Life continued, ten years passed, and I picked up a copy of Tim Ferris&rsquo;s book&nbsp;The 4-Hour Body. In his chapter on &ldquo;Rapid Fat Loss,&rdquo; he offered a passing sentence when asked about boredom with the limited food options in his prescribed diet: &ldquo;Most people vastly overestimate the variety of their meals.&rdquo; My mind immediately raced back to my role models in Wisconsin from so many years ago, both of whom had chosen to eat the same meal every day for lunch. They had discovered a routine that worked well for them. Rather than fighting against routine in their diet, they had embraced the practice. Few could argue with the results&mdash;both were healthy and successful. It got me thinking&hellip; What if there is nothing wrong with eating the same meal over and over again? In fact, what if repetition is a good thing? Why not embrace it? You Could Already Be There. As a blogger and overall promoter of the benefits of minimalism, I have seen countless times how people overestimate the number of material possessions they need. So when I read the sentence in Tim&rsquo;s book that &ldquo;most people vastly overestimate the variety of their meals,&rdquo; I almost instinctively knew it was true. I have seen &ldquo;overestimating variety&rdquo; to be true in clothing, entertainment, books, linens, and any number of other examples. Why not food? The Pareto principle is proven true over and over again&mdash;roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. We wear 20% of our clothes 80% of the time. We use 20% of our kitchen gadgets 80% of the time. We watch 20% of the same channels 80% of the time. And, generally speaking, we eat 20% of the same food 80% of the time. Just think about what you have had to eat for breakfast over the past week. Most likely, you&rsquo;ve eaten the same couple meals. Or how about lunch? My breakfast these days, when I eat it, is two eggs and four strips of turkey bacon. My lunch consists of rotisserie chicken (with Frank&rsquo;s buffalo sauce) or a salad (with chicken). And I know I&rsquo;m far from alone in these kinds of habits. According to one study conducted in Great Britain by Whole Foods Market, almost 33% of us eat the same lunch every day. Here&rsquo;s the reality: We tend to eat many of the same foods over and over again, but for some reason, we want to deny this truth. We contend that variety is the spice of life. Or we remember our mom telling us, &ldquo;But you just ate pizza yesterday. You can&rsquo;t eat it again today.&rdquo; We think it reflects poorly on our cultured-self or creativity or palate or commitment to health to eat the same foods over and over again. So we quickly convince ourselves that we need to think up something new every day for breakfast or lunch or to feed our family in the evening. But as I&rsquo;ve thought more about it, I&rsquo;ve realized there really is much benefit to be found in leaning in to the reality that we crave stability in our meal patterns. We eat less variety than we think&mdash;and there are good reasons to realize that and accept it. Why You Should Say Yes to Meal Routine. Speaking at a conference several years ago, I was asked by a mother of three for advice on how to keep down food waste and costs in her home. By this time I was a convert to meal repetition. I answered, &ldquo;Accept the fact that you eat less variety of foods than you think. Don&rsquo;t fight against it. Don&rsquo;t believe society&rsquo;s pressure that you need to be dreaming up something new for every meal. Find your family&rsquo;s favorite meals and serve them often. You&rsquo;ll lower your monthly food costs, waste, and time spent in preparation.&rdquo; Consider the benefits to us (and our families) of establishing a regular meal rotation: 1. Money savings.&nbsp;When you begin to establish a weekly routine of your family&rsquo;s favorite meals, you save money by wasting less, learning the correct portion size, recognizing sales and good prices, and knowing which spices or condiments to purchase. 2. Time savings.&nbsp;Not only does a weekly routine of meals save time hunting for recipes or new ideas, but we become more and more efficient at preparing each of the meals that we do enjoy. This &ldquo;time saved&rdquo; may be more precious during specific seasons of life (when you have young children at home, for example), but extra time in the day can be appreciated by everyone. 3. Better health.&nbsp;A thought-out and intentional routine of meals offers greater opportunity to align our diets with nutritional recommendations. 4. Less food waste.&nbsp;About 150,000 tons of food is tossed out in US households each day, equivalent to about a third of the daily calories that each American consumes. Not only does this waste take a toll on our household budget (as mentioned above), but there is also an environmental toll from that much waste. 5. Weight control.&nbsp;Many people who eat the same lunch every day attest that the practice is helpful in weight control, contending they eat less because of it. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;school cafeteria syndrome,&rdquo; and according to researchers, it really works in reducing the amount of food we eat. 6. Fewer failed recipes.&nbsp;As I will mention in a moment, there is still room for trying new foods and recipes, and I recommend it with young kids at home. But establishing a stable routine of meals each week and experimenting with fewer new recipes means fewer failed meals. As I can attest, there are few things in life more disheartening than spending hours preparing a meal, only to have it flop at the dinner table. 7. Benefits for kids.&nbsp;The more children see specific foods in front of them, the more likely they are to learn to enjoy them. Creating a routine certainly doesn&rsquo;t eliminate all &ldquo;eat your vegetables&rdquo; negotiations at the dinner table, but they do make them easier, as the expectations have already been established. 8. Greater simplicity.&nbsp;Embracing a meal routine (whether daily or weekly) promotes simplicity in our home and life. It reduces stress and anxiety, removes decision fatigue, and frees us to pursue more important things than answering &ldquo;What&rsquo;s for dinner?&rdquo; How to Implement a Meal Rotation. How do we go about this in our own unique families? Here are some thoughts to get you started: 1. Meals on your own are a great place to start.&nbsp; If you eat lunch every day at the office, it&rsquo;s easy to choose your one or two favorite meals and repeat them each day. The same is true for breakfast if you eat it alone. As mentioned above, breakfast and lunch are where I embrace the most routine. 2. Determine your family&rsquo;s favorite meals.&nbsp; Take each person into account. Are there specific meals that everybody likes? If so, those are obvious places to start establishing a routine. I&rsquo;d recommend identifying five or six family favorites. If you can&rsquo;t get that much agreement in your family, be sure to think about those with pickier palettes and what accommodations can be made. 3. Write out a weekly schedule that can be repeated each week.&nbsp; Take into account your weekly commitments. Does someone have volleyball practice on Tuesday night? Youth group on Wednesday? Or a business meeting on Monday? Factor in both the time you have to prepare and the time to sit down and eat. My family loves tacos on Tuesdays. And we serve pizza on Sunday evenings because my son typically works late and my wife and I take my daughter to church that night. 4. Don&rsquo;t sacrifice health.&nbsp; Eating foods you enjoy doesn&rsquo;t mean sacrificing healthy nutrition habits along the way. If you&rsquo;re serving pizza or pasta, pick a vegetable to go with it. Or look for healthy options of pizza. I actually find it easier to eat healthy when a routine has been established, because we are intentional about including fruits and vegetables every evening. 5. Don&rsquo;t think you need to sacrifice all variety for this to work.&nbsp; Rare is the family for whom a week&rsquo;s schedule doesn&rsquo;t vary from time to time, so some variety in meals is almost inevitable. But it can also be scheduled. You can decide that every Monday is new-recipe day, or you can choose variety when you eat out. Establishing a meal routine five nights of the week still leaves room for plenty of variety. 6. Proceed with trial, error, and adjustments.&nbsp; If you discover that one meal takes longer to prepare than you want, change it. If one meal is no longer enjoyed by your family, pick a new one. Or if you discover that a routine works well for one month and then you want to make a new one, go for it! The goal is to find something that works for your family and saves you time and money. Eat. Repeat. One of the greatest things I have discovered about minimalism is that removing unneeded things from my life means I am left with only my favorites. Another benefit is that removing distraction brings money, time, energy, and peace into my life. I have found the same benefits by leaning in to the reality that we eat less variety of foods than we think. We all have our favorite foods to eat. Accept it and embrace the idea of eating the same foods over and over again. You&rsquo;ll be excited every time you sit down to eat&hellip;and you&rsquo;ll save money and time along the way."

            "articleBody": "&lsquo;Tis the season for spring cleaning. No doubt, all over the internet and in countless magazines, there are going to be numerous articles published in the next month about how to spring clean your home. And I get it, I lived in that world for many years. I lived through plenty of winters growing up and can fully appreciate the arrival of spring and the feeling of life and newness that accompanies it. And I know the beauty of being able to open the windows and doors after being cooped up in the house all winter. Spring is a natural time of year to deep clean your home. And I&rsquo;m all for it. I think you should do it and do it well. However, before you jump into your spring cleaning, and every time you stumble upon an article about spring cleaning, I want you to remember one phrase: Spring decluttering is better than Spring cleaning. In fact, the best spring cleaning begins with spring decluttering. Because the less you own, the easier it is to clean. Plus, the benefits of decluttering extend far beyond the springtime. Spring decluttering results in a home that is easier to clean every week of every season. And owning less results in a home that is more calm and more peaceful every day. Consider just three rooms as an example: Living Room. One of the first rooms we decluttered on our minimizing journey was the living room&mdash;including the decorations. We had shelves and shelves of them. I remember vividly removing the decorations that were no longer important to us, leaving just a few that told our story. When I was finished, I decided to dust the shelves and immediately noticed how much easier it was to dust the shelves with fewer items on them. Go figure. I don&rsquo;t know why this had never occurred to me. Fewer things to move, meant the room was easier to clean. Toy Room. Another great example is the toy room. Our kids were five and two. We eventually decluttered many of the toys they didn&rsquo;t need, had stopped using, or had broken along the way. Everything that remained fit comfortably against one wall. The following evening when we went to clean up their toys, the entire project took less than a few minutes. Fewer toys meant the entire room was easier to clean, daily. Closets. A third example is the closet. While we didn&rsquo;t begin our decluttering journey in the closet, I eventually removed 75% of the clothes from my side of the closet. My closet immediately became stream-lined, spacious, and easier to keep organized. But more than that, the positive affects spilled over into other rooms as well. Returning clothes at the end of the day became easier so there were fewer clothes left out in the bedroom. Putting clothes away after the laundry cycle became less burdensome. As was returning accessories: shoes, belts, jewelry, even coats and gloves. &nbsp; The less we owned, the easier it was to clean. Spring cleaning should always begin with spring decluttering. Because spring decluttering makes spring cleaning infinitely easier. Here are a few quick tips to get you started: 1. Start in your easiest spaces. Don&rsquo;t try to declutter your attic, home office, or sentimental collections first. Start with easier wins like the living room, bedroom, or car. 2. Begin in your lived-in areas. Again, avoid the attic and the basement when getting started. You can spend hours decluttering, shut the door, and never see the room again for weeks. But if you declutter your living room, you&rsquo;ll notice the calm every time you sit to watch television. If you declutter your kitchen, you&rsquo;ll notice it immediately the next time you prepare a meal and cleaning the kitchen every evening will be noticeably easier. 3. Physically touch every item in your home. When you hold an item in your hand, you are forced to make a decision about it. Every item you touch can either be relocated, removed, or returned. Put as many things as you can in the remove pile. 4. Ask three questions. Ask yourself three questions for every item you touch: Do I need it?Why do I have it?What would I use if I didn&rsquo;t own it? 5. Donate, donate, donate. As you begin removing clutter from your home, donate as much as you can. Trying to sell all your clutter only adds stress and burden to an already difficult process. Expensive items (or if you desperately need the money) are the only exceptions. For the most part, find a local charity that you believe in and donate your things there. 6. Find inspiration to keep going. Find as much motivation and inspiration as you need. The reality is this process is going to take more than one day, or even one weekend. So, find your places of encouragement. You can watch my YouTube channel, check out the Archives page of this blog, download the Clutterfree App, or find another blogger that you resonate with. Either way, the more you are reminded that owning less is better, the easier it will be to declutter your stuff. And like I said before, the less you own, the easier it is to clean. And that&rsquo;s why: Spring decluttering is always better than spring cleaning."

        <p>
         Minimalism is the intentional promotion of the things we most value and the removal of anything that distracts us from it. It is about focus, intentionality, and making the most of the one life we have been given.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is also a growing movement around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
         But there are many who still misinterpret the term. They think it is about barren walls, cold environments, or empty cupboards. But they are incorrect.
        </p>
        <p>
         Minimalism isn’t about owning less than you need, it’s about owning
         <em>
          exactly
         </em>
         what you need.
        </p>
        <p>
         Correctly applied, minimalism results in more money, more time, more focus, and less stress. It also results in a life of greater joy, greater meaning, and
         <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/shortcut-to-significance/">
          greater significance
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         If you are drawn to the benefits of minimalism, but still apprehensive, here are ten things you can do today to test out the lifestyle and live more like a minimalist.
        </p>
        <h3>
         10 Things You Can Do Today to Live More Like a Minimalist
        </h3>
        <p>
         <strong>
          1. Remove one box of clutter from your home.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Minimalists own fewer possessions. As a result, their homes feel more peaceful, more calm, more spacious, and less stressful. You may not be able to declutter your entire home in one day (It took us nine months), but you can make a little bit of progress.
        </p>
        <p>
         Try to remove one entire box of clutter from one room in your home. And then, notice the difference it makes.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          2. Clear one surface.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Every physical possession in our field of vision results in
         <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/visual-noise/">
          visual clutter
         </a>
         . Our eyes naturally gravitate to the things around us as we subconsciously scan our surroundings on a constant basis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Find one surface in your home that you can clear entirely (a bathroom counter, a coffee table, a shelf, or a nightstand) and remove everything from it. Notice the clear surface. Now, imagine that feeling throughout your entire home.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          3. Don’t buy anything and put $49 into savings.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         The average American spends almost
         <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/05/07/americans-spend-thousands-on-nonessentials/39450207/">
          $18,000 a year on nonessentials
         </a>
         . If you want to take one small step toward living more like a minimalist today, don’t buy a single nonessential item. Then, put that $49 into a savings account. Tomorrow, do the same thing. You’ll be surprised how quickly your savings account will fill up when you stop buying stuff you don’t need.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          4. Go for a long walk.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Walking is good for the soul and the body. It provides opportunity to think and reflect on life. If you want to live more like a minimalist, go for a nice long walk today.
        </p>
        <p>
         Notice how wonderful it feels to have some extra time in your day to breathe and relax. And while you walk, consider the direction of your life and if you’re living to your fullest potential. Would removing some distractions allow you to focus more on things that matter?
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          5. Turn off the notifications on your phone.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Minimalists work to remove distractions from their day—whether it be unnecessary possessions, unnecessary appointments, or unnecessary notifications like email or social media (or even texts).
        </p>
        <p>
         For the rest of the day, turn off all notifications
         <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/break-your-cell-phone-habit/">
          on your phone
         </a>
         except for phone calls (even text messaging). See how it changes the feel of your entire day. Tomorrow morning, turn on just the notifications you actually missed.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          6. Eliminate one obligation.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Minimalism extends beyond physical possessions. It sparks intentionality in all areas—
         <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/love/">
          relationships
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/habits-to-change-your-life/">
          habits
         </a>
         , and your
         <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/un-busy/">
          schedule
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Today, eliminate one obligation from your life that you do not enjoy or does not further your greatest passions and pursuits. Make the phone call, send the email, cancel the reservation… whatever you need to do. Reclaim your time to live the life you desire to live.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          7. Make up one game with your kids.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Studies show us over and over again that
         <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/why-fewer-toys-will-actually-benefit-your-kids/">
          fewer toys  are beneficial to our children
         </a>
         . Advertisements may tell us the newest toy will result in a better childhood for your kids, but that’s simply not true. Fewer toys consistently provide opportunity for
         <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/singletons/201712/study-underscores-why-fewer-toys-is-the-better-option">
          deeper play
         </a>
         and imagination to develop in your family.
        </p>
        <p>
         So grab a few toys and make up a new game (such as an obstacle course) with your kids tonight. You’ll see the value of less, and have a great time too.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          8. Wear your favorite outfit.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         It’s true,
         <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/a-practical-guide-to-owning-fewer-clothes/">
          most minimalists own fewer clothes than other people
         </a>
         . But not because owning fewer clothes is a sacrifice. Just the opposite in fact. Owning fewer clothes means everything hanging in my closet is my favorite. There’s nothing I’d rather wear than
         <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/7-reasons-i-wear-the-same-thing-every-day/">
          my favorite outfit every day
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Today, wear your favorite outfit. Notice what you like about it. And then, imagine a world where you get to wear that every day.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          9. Turn off your television one hour earlier than normal.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         Because minimalists have embraced a more intentional approach to life, they remove unhealthy habits. For me, removing television was one of the most important. And while I still sit down to watch sports with my son or an occasional series on Netflix, television is no longer a focal point of my life.
         <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/ten-reasons-to-watch-less-television/">
          It no longer robs me of life and potential
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Tonight, turn off the television one hour earlier than normal. Use the free time to talk with your spouse, write in a journal, go for that walk, or go to bed an hour earlier. Almost anything you choose will be more worthwhile.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          10. Do one thing you love.
         </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
         The greatest thing about minimalism is that it frees money, time, and energy for your
         <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/own-less-stuff-pursue-your-passions-finally/">
          greatest passions
         </a>
         . This is the greatest benefit—a life lived focused on the pursuits that result in true happiness, joy, meaning, and fulfillment.
        </p>
        <p>
         So today, do one thing you love. And then, imagine yourself doing more of that every single day from here on out. And you’ll get a small picture of why people continue to flock to the message of minimalism.
        </p>
        <p>
         Minimalism isn’t about living a boring life detached from reality. It is about rejecting society’s version of reality and
         <a href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/the-helpful-guide-to-living-an-intentional-life/">
          living a focused, intentional life
         </a>
         on your own terms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Try out just one or two of these small steps today—and begin experiencing what the rest of your life can look like. You’ll love minimalism and you’ll love owning less.
