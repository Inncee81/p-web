            As far as I know, nobody in a quarter-century of trying has invented a meaningful way to quantify website traffic, and every method for putting a supposedly precise number to it is an advertising gimmick. Why on Earth would we write a reliance upon an ad gimmick into federal law? It's like changing the penalties for a crime based on the quantity of bad vibes that it generated.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's a wild idea: Why don't we have a National Commission on Internet Regulation before we try to write legislation?

            Netflix's crackdown on password sharing
           </a>

          <blockquote style="font-style:italic;">
           <p>
            Don't forget that Netflix is also now a part of the MPAA. Maybe that could have something to do with this crackdown? After all, many other members are against password sharing. And that's not to mention that they want everyone to never pirate and pay for every movie they want to own and every single streaming service that has something they want to watch. And pay for their Internet connection to watch said streaming sites. And their phone bill. And their electricity. And their water bill. And their rent. And groceries. And anything else they need to support a family. And probably more. And put some money in savings. And have an in case of an immediate emergency fund. And pay for gifts and other things they might want to buy. All while working a minimum wage job.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tell me: Who has the ability to pay for all that under those circumstances? That's why piracy exists. Not because they're too lazy to go to the store. Not because they don't want to support the filmmakers/artists/creators of the content they consume. And not because they just want to get content for free. It's because if there was no piracy, they wouldn't consume the content at all. Period. So maybe ask them if they would rather have those who share passwords move over to a torrent site instead, and see how quickly they change their views.

           David Harris is our one returning winner this year, having topped
           <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200212/16451743913/announcing-winners-2nd-annual-public-domain-game-jam.shtml">

            </em>
           </a>
           with the game
           <a href="https://sciartica.itch.io/the-24th-kandinsky">
            <em>
             The 24th Kandinsky
            </em>
           </a>
           . This year's entry is at once similar and very different: like that previous game,
           <em>
            Fish Magic
           </em>
           is about exploring the work of a famous painter, but it takes an entirely new approach to doing so. And that change of approach underlines what makes both games so compelling: their mechanics are carefully crafted to perfectly suit the artworks at their core. Where
           <em>
            The 24th Kandinsky
           </em>
           was about manipulating the shapes and colors of Kandinsky's abstract art,
           <em>
            Fish Magic
           </em>
           is about letting the evocative surrealism of the titular painting by Paul Klee spark your imagination. To that end, the painting becomes the game board, and is populated by words randomly selected from a list, poetically divided into the "domains" of Celestial, Earthly, and Aquatic:
          </p>
          <p class="centered">
           <img src="https://i.imgur.com/46d0Zy9.png" style="max-width:580px;"/>
          </p>
          <p>
           The players take turns moving between nodes on the board, taking a word from each one to build a collection, which they can then use to build phrases when they are ready. The goal is to convince the other players that your constructed phrase represents either a type of "magic fish", or a type of "fish magic". Points are gained by winning the support of other players for your fish magic or your magic fish, and reduced according to how many extra words you have sitting in your collection, thus encouraging players to be extra creative and find ways to make convincing phrases with the words they have, rather than just chasing the ones they want.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you're wondering what exactly makes for a good type of fish magic or magic fish, or what that even means — well, that's kind of the point, and exactly why this approach to the game is so perfect for the source material! Paul Klee's painting is appreciated for its magical depiction of a mysterious and intriguing underwater world, and the way its techniques — a layer of black paint scratched off to reveal vibrant colours underneath, and a square of muslin glued to the center of the canvas — suggest wondrous depths obscured by a hazy curtain.
           <em>
            Fish Magic
           </em>
           the painting provokes imagination and flights of fancy, and
           <em>
            Fish Magic
           </em>
           the game adds just enough mechanical scaffolding to make this process explicit
           <em>
            and
           </em>
           collaborative.
          </p>
          <p>
           Anyone could slap a board layout on a famous painting, add some rules, and call it a game — but it takes a real appreciation for the painting, and a real intent to do something meaningful with it, to craft such a simple premise that so perfectly aligns with the source material. Like
           <em>
            The 24th Kandinsky
           </em>
           last year, just a quick read of the rules was enough to make our judges eager to play, and it was an easy choice for the Best Analog Game.

That perhaps makes it somewhat ironic that several of our posts dealing with the franchise have to do with mass media outlets getting confused into thinking its augmentation stories were

           storyline were of the grand variety: takeover of government by biomedical companies pushing a vaccine for a sickness it created, the illuminati, FEMA takeovers, AI-driven surveillance of the public, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           And it's the fact that such conspiracy-driven thinking today led Warren Spector, the creator of the series, to recently state that he probably
           <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2021/03/16/warren-spector-conspiracy-theories/">
            wouldn't have created the game today if given the chance

             Deus Ex was originally released in 2000 but took place in an alternate 2052 where many of the real world conspiracy theories have come true. The plot included references to vaccinations, black helicopters, FEMA, and ECHELON amongst others, some of which have connotations to real-life events. Spector said, “Interestingly, I’m not sure I’d make Deus Ex today. The conspiracy theories we wrote about are now part of the real world. I don’t want to support that.”

           This could be a post about how drastically disinformation has altered our society. Or it could be a post about how some of the very real aspects of modern surveillance have so warped the trust between the public and government so as to allow more conspiracy theories to better breathe.
          </p>
          <p>
           But I think instead I'd like to focus on how clearly this illustrates the artistic nature of video games. The desire, or not, to create certain kinds of art due to the reflection such art receives from the broader society is exactly the kind of thing artists operating in other artforms have to deal with. Art imitates life, yes, but in the case of speculative fiction like this, it appears that life can also imitate art. Spector notes that seeing what has happened in the world since
           <em>
            Deus Ex
           </em>
           was first released in 2000 has had a profound effect on him as an artist.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            <em>
             Earlier, Spector had commented on how he was “constantly amazed at how accurate our view of the world ended up being. Frankly it freaks me out a bit.” Some of the conspiracy theories that didn’t end up in the game were those surrounding Denver Airport because they were considered “too silly to include in the game.” These include theories about secret tunnels, connections to aliens and Nazi secret societies, and hidden messages within the airport’s artwork. Spector is now incredulous that they’re “something people actually believe.”
            </em>

          </blockquote>
          <p>
           If you had thought that the debate over whether video games are an artform was settled, you haven't been paying attention. To this day, there are very

           understanding the artform, particularly when it comes to whether video games receive the same First Amendment protections as movies and literature.
          </p>
          <p>
           Hopefully, artists like Spector, engaging in these types of artistic internal debates, can help solidify the understanding further.

            Summary:
           </strong>
           After Amazon refused to continue hosting Parler, the Twitter competitor favored by the American far-right, former Parler users looking to communicate with each other -- but dodge strict moderation -- adopted Telegram as their go-to service. Following the attack on the Capitol building in Washington, DC, chat app Telegram
           <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22238755/telegram-messaging-social-media-extremists">
            added 25 million users in a little over 72 hours
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           Telegram has long been home to far-right groups, who often find their communications options limited by moderation policies that, unsurprisingly, remove violent or hateful content. Telegram's moderation is
           <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/terror-on-telegram/">
            comparatively more lax
           </a>
           than several of its social media competitors, making it the app of choice for
           <a href="https://t.me/MiloOfficial">
            far right personalities
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           But Telegram appears to be attempting to
           <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/13/extremists-fringe-social-media-election-fraud-436369">
            handle the influx of users
           </a>
           -- along with an influx of disturbing content. Some channels broadcasting extremist content
           <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/telegram-recent-haven-far-right-purges-extremist-content-n1254215">
            have been removed by Telegram
           </a>
           as the increasingly-popular chat service flexes its (until now rarely used) moderation muscle. According to the service, at least fifteen channels were removed by Telegram moderators, some of which were filled with white supremacist content.
          </p>
          <p>
           Unfortunately, policing the service remains difficult. While Telegram claims to have blocked "dozens" of channels containing "calls to violence," journalists have had little trouble finding similarly violent content on the service, which either has eluded moderation or is being ignored by Telegram. While Telegram appears responsive to some notifications of potentially-illegal content, it also appears to be inconsistent in
           <a href="https://t.me/durov/149">
            applying its own rule
           </a>
           against inciting violence.

             Does Telegram's promise of user security and privacy dissuade it from engaging in more active content moderation?

           <li>
            <p>
             Is context considered when engaging in moderation to avoid accidentally blocking people sharing content they feel is concerning, rather than promoting the content or endorsing its message?
            </p>
           </li>
           <li>
            <p>
             Do reports of mass content violations (and lax moderation) draw extremists to Telegram? Does this increase the chance of the moderation problem "snowballing" into something that can no longer be managed effectively?
            </p>
           </li>
          </ul>
          <strong>
           Resolution:
          </strong>
          Telegram continues to take a mostly hands-off approach to moderation but appears to be more responsive to complaints about calls to violence than it has been in the past. As it continues to draw more users -- many of whom have been kicked off other platforms -- its existing moderation issues are only going to increase.

           Over the last year or two, conspiracy theory-driven attacks in both the UK and US have ramped up not just on telecom infrastructure, but on telecom workers themselves. From

           to injure workers, it's getting exceptionally dumb and dangerous. To the point where gangs of people have threatened telecom workers who

            don't even work in wireless

           .
          </p>
          <p>
           As

            the Intercept notes
           </a>
           , the rise in attacks has finally gotten the attention of law enforcement. In New York, law enforcement has finally keyed into the fact that the conspiracy theories have fused white supremacists and Q Anon dipshittery into one problematic mess that's resulting in concrete harm. White supremacists (here and abroad) have apparently figured out they can amplify and contribute to the conspiracy theories to generate more chaos for the American institutions they're eager to demolish. All stuff that's being amplified in turn by governments like Iran and Russia eager for the same outcome.
          </p>
          <p>
           While superficially a lot of these folks have the coherence of mud, in many cases the attacks are very elaborate, and specifically targeted:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <em>
            <p>
             "In one case, it says, on December 14, 2020, an individual or individuals broke into a cellphone tower ground station in Fairview, West Virginia, severing the tower’s main power cable and removing the primary and back-up generator batteries. The tower had provided wireless coverage throughout West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, and the damages totaled over $28,000.
            </p>
            <p>
             In another instance, an unknown individual is said to have sneaked into a cell tower site in Tennessee on December 19, 2020, by cutting open its perimeter fence. The individual then severed the site’s fiber-optic cables and damaged several other telecommunications components, resulting in a “significant disruption of service for approximately 12 hours."
            </p>
           </em>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Many of these attacks are orchestrated by folks who know exactly what they're targeting. Often it's the loopy pudding-brained aspect of these stories that gets the most attention. Less talked about historically is how this bullshit enables white supremacist accelerationist fantasies, something law enforcement chatter is starting to more accurately discuss after decades (centuries?) of apathy:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <em>
            <p>
             "In recent months, white supremacist extremists, neo-Nazis, far-right Telegram groups, and online conspiracy theorists have all emphasized attacking valuable critical infrastructure targets.” Many far-right groups adhere to the “accelerationist” principle, which maintains that hastening the collapse of society will bring about political change. Targeting critical infrastructure, which impedes the state’s ability to function, is a common insurgency tactic used by militant groups worldwide."
            </p>
           </em>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Conspiracy theories work so well in America thanks to decades of greed slowly nibbling away at cornerstones of a functioning democracy, whether that's a lack of cohesive, affordable mental health care, a government gridlocked by corruption, or a press that still can't pay journalists a living wage while Instagram influencers nab million dollar contracts.

            Less informed, intentionally agitated
           </a>
           , and increasingly faithless in the ability of institutions to protect them, the public clings to anything they can to feel in control, and that increasingly winds up being... complete and total bullshit. A systemic failure that's then exploited and amplified by no limit of bad actors, both foreign and domestic.

           There was a time when a key part of the Republicans' political platform was for "tort reform" and reducing the ability of civil lawsuits to be brought against companies. The argument they made (and to which they
           <a href="https://www.ksla.com/2020/02/15/republicans-focus-tort-reform-during-upcoming-legislative-session/">
            still give lip service
           </a>
           ) is that too much liability leads to a barrage of frivolous nuisance litigation, which only benefits greedy trial lawyers. Apparently, that concept has been tossed out the window -- as with so many Republican principles -- if you mention "big tech." The latest example of this is a new Section 230 reform bill introduced by Representative Jim Banks called the
           <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20518057/stop_shielding_culpable_platforms_act_-_bill_text_03122021.pdf" target="_blank">
            "Stop Shielding Culpable Platforms Act"
           </a>
           which would massively increase liability on any company that hosts user content online.
          </p>
          <p>
           Banks trumpeted his own confusion on this issue earlier in the week by tweeting -- falsely -- that
           <a href="https://twitter.com/RepJimBanks/status/1372556478301806593" target="_blank">
            "Section 230 knowingly lets Big Tech distribute child pornography without fear of legal repercussions."
           </a>
           This is wrong. Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is very, very, very much illegal and any website hosting it faces
           <b>
            serious
           </b>
           liability issues. Section 230 does not cover federal criminal law, and CSAM
           <a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos/citizens-guide-us-federal-law-child-pornography" target="_blank">
            violates federal criminal law
           </a>
           . Furthermore, federal law
           <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2258A" target="_blank">
            requires every website to report the discovery of CSAM
           </a>
           to the CyberTipline run by NCMEC.
          </p>
          <p>
           The law is pretty clear here and you'd
           <em>
            think

           that a sitting member of Congress could, perhaps, have had someone look it up?

           And yet, Banks seems to ignore all of this. And that leads to this new law. To be fair, the law itself is not as insane and disconnected from reality as so many other Section 230 bills, but it's still ridiculous. It's all built on the false argument that websites are free to knowingly host this kind of content. In fact, the bill is mostly performative. The vast majority of the bill is actually Banks misrepresenting news stories to make it sound -- falsely -- like websites are free to knowingly host CSAM.
          </p>
          <p>
           The actual change to 230 is much shorter -- but the impact would basically flip Section 230's role on its head, and would lead to two things I
           <em>
            thought
           </em>
           Republicans were against: widespread suppression of speech online and a massive influx of frivolous and vexatious litigation. Here's the change. It would add in this paragraph to Section 230:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <em>
            <p>
             ‘‘(B) NO EFFECT ON TREATMENT AS DISTRIBUTOR.—Nothing in subparagraph (A) shall
be construed to prevent a provider or user of an interactive computer service from being treated
as the distributor of information provided by another information content provider.’’.
            </p>
           </em>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           To understand all this, it helps to understand the different kinds of liability that existed pre-Section 230. This history is well documented in Jeff Kosseff's excellent book on
           <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190423/08343442067/techdirt-podcast-episode-209-past-future-section-230.shtml">
            the history of Section 230
           </a>
           . The key case here was
           <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/361/147/" target="_blank">
            Smith v. California

           Either way, the Supreme Court ruled in the Smith case that while obscene books are not constitutionally protected, you can't hold the bookseller liable if they did not have knowledge of the contents of the book and how it was obscene. And thus, the Supreme Court established a somewhat messy "distributor liability" standard, in which you could be liable for books you distributed... but there had to be some knowledge by the distributor of the illegality of the material. The court -- somewhat explicitly -- refused to discuss what "mental element is requisite" to prove knowledge. This distributor liability was considered different from "publisher liability," because the assumption was that if you're the actual publisher, then you obviously have knowledge of the material in question.
          </p>
          <p>
           This resulted in a lot of confusion in the ensuing years -- and pre-Section 230 -- there was
           <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200805/07260045045/revisiting-common-law-liability-online-intermediaries-before-section-230.shtml">
            a lot of concern
           </a>
           about how that would play out on the early internet (or even with other distributors). Eventually, with the ruling in the
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratton_Oakmont,_Inc._v._Prodigy_Services_Co." target="_blank">
            Stratton Oakmont v. Prodigy
           </a>
           case, a judge leapt right past distributor liability, and said that Prodigy actually had
           <em>
            publisher
           </em>
           liability for defamatory material, simply because it did some moderation.
          </p>
          <p>
           Section 230 was written, explicitly, to overrule the decision in the Prodigy case. However, since the Prodigy case focused on actual publisher liability, and didn't even get into the weeds of distributor liability, there was some early confusion as to whether or not Section 230 actually protected against distributor liability as well. Indeed, some observers of internet law were
           <a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2021/02/how-section-230-makes-my-life-better-a-celebration-of-its-25-year-anniversary.htm" target="_blank">
            initially unimpressed by Section 230
           </a>
           , suggesting that it might be useful, but not until courts really had weighed in on the "jumbled mess" of secondary liability frameworks and how 230 impacted them. That changed after the first big case involving Section 230,
           <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeran_v._America_Online,_Inc." target="_blank">
            Zeran v. AOL
           </a>
           , which read 230 broadly to say that it prohibited all such civil liability -- including distributor liability.
          </p>
          <p>
           Since then, Section 230's authors -- Chris Cox and Ron Wyden -- have repeatedly said that the court in Zeran got it exactly right. They have noted, correctly, that any other interpretation of 230 would make it close to useless, because it would lead to a bunch of frivolous lawsuits involving wasteful fighting over discovery to prove "knowledge."
          </p>
          <p>
           But, apparently, that's what Jim Banks and the Republican Study Committee he leads want. A lot more liability and costly legal fights over discovery to prove knowledge and create liability for distributors. I mean, it's so ridiculous that it might even lead trial lawyers -- a group that has historically backed Democrats -- to start stumping for Republicans since this will open up the field to tons of costly litigation. And, of course, adding back in distributor liability won't magically fix the issues that Banks claims he's trying to fix because -- as already noted -- allowing CSAM on any website is already very, very much illegal, and a huge liability. So none of that changes.
          </p>
          <p>
           The only actual change created by this bill is that it... will enable lawsuits against tons of websites. And, in order to avoid some of that costly litigating, many websites will also enable the heckler's veto. All anyone will ever have to do to remove content they dislike from the internet is send a notice
           <em>
            claiming
           </em>
           the content violates some law (defamation being the easiest, but there are others as well). Then, they'll be able to claim "knowledge" if the website refuses to remove it. That means that most websites will be quick to remove
           <em>
            any
           </em>
           content that someone claims is defamatory, no matter how ridiculous.
          </p>
          <p>
           We already know how this works out because it's kind of the way the DMCA works today -- except that at least with the DMCA there are some built in counternotice provisions. But already the DMCA is
           <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170406/15271537100/revenge-pornster-craig-brittain-issues-dmca-notices-demanding-google-delist-entire-websites-including-wikipedia.shtml">
            abused
           </a>
           to try to hide information. And Banks' change, should it become law, would make that much more widely available. At least under the DMCA, sites can more easily see that, say a negative review, is obviously not copyright infringing. Whether or not it's
           <em>
            defamatory
           </em>
           is not something a website can easily judge -- and therefore it's much more likely to just pull down the content.
          </p>
          <p>
           This bill wouldn't just change Section 230, it would flip the entire logic of 230 on its head. Rather than giving websites the flexibility and personal responsibility to moderate in a manner to fit their own community, it would cause nearly every website to start pulling down content at the first whiff of controversy. Rather than enabling free speech online, it would stifle it. Indeed, one might argue that under this law, Twitter would be forced to pull down Banks' tweet about this law. After all it could be argued that it defames Twitter itself in falsely claiming the company knowingly hosts CSAM. Under Banks' law, Twitter would become liable for those false claims... about Twitter.
          </p>
          <p>
           It's a weird flex for a Republican to push for greater suppression of speech and more frivolous lawsuits, but that's what Jim Banks is doing here. What amazing times we live in.

           As a bunch of US lawmakers keep threatening new laws that would force websites to remove more content, we should note just how much such moves reflect what is happening in China. The NY Times reports that Microsoft is in hot water in China, because LinkedIn
           <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/technology/china-linkedin-censorship.html" target="_blank">
            apparently has been too slow
           </a>
           to block content that displeases the Chinese government. As the article notes, LinkedIn is the one major US social network that is allowed in China -- but only if it follows China's Great Firewall censorship rules.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you're not familiar with how that works, it's not that the government tells you what to take down -- it's just that the government makes it clear that if you let something through that you shouldn't, you're going to hear about it, and risk punishment. And it appears that's exactly what's happened to Microsoft:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <em>
            <p>
             China’s internet regulator rebuked LinkedIn executives this month for failing to control political content, according to three people briefed on the matter. Though it isn’t clear precisely what material got the company into trouble, the regulator said it had found objectionable posts circulating in the period around an annual meeting of China’s lawmakers, said these people, who asked for anonymity because the issue isn’t public.
            </p>
            <p>
             As a punishment, the people said, officials are requiring LinkedIn to perform a self-evaluation and offer a report to the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s internet regulator. The service was also forced to suspend new sign-ups of users inside China for 30 days, one of the people added, though that period could change depending on the administration’s judgment.
            </p>
           </em>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Or, Microsoft/LinkedIn could do the right thing and tell the Chinese government "sorry," and just stop doing business in China. The NY Times article even notes that LinkedIn doesn't even get that much usage in China. So why bother with this hassle in a way that makes the company look so bad?
          </p>
          <p>
           Also, I'll just note the grand irony of Microsoft doing this just a week or so after Microsoft's President Brad Smith
           <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/12/technology-and-the-free-press-the-need-for-healthy-journalism-in-a-healthy-democracy/" target="_blank">
            testified before Congress
           </a>
           on how "technology companies" must support "democracy." Of course, in that context, Smith was just doing it to
           <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210302/17264946349/microsoft-attacks-open-web-because-jealous-googles-success.shtml">
            attack Google
           </a>
           and the open web. But, hey, as long as it can get money from China, apparently all that "democracy" stuff isn't so important to Microsoft any more.

           Giant US ISPs have long (ab)used the lack of competition in the broadband market by imposing completely

            arbitrary and unnecessary monthly usage caps and overage fees
           </a>
           . They've also taken to

            exempting their own content
           </a>
           from these arbitrary limits while still penalizing competitors -- allowing them to tilt the playing field in their favor (or the favor of other deep pocketed giants). For example, an AT&amp;T broadband customer who uses AT&amp;T's own streaming services (like HBO Max) faces no bandwidth penalties or fees. If that same customer uses Netflix or a competitor they're
           <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181220/08015941270/att-lets-users-avoid-broadband-capsif-they-use-ats-own-streaming-service.shtml">
            socked with surcharges
           </a>

           When the FCC passed net neutrality rules in 2015, it failed to recognize how this "zero rating" could be abused anticompetitively. They were
           <b>
            just

           starting to

            figure this out and shift policy positions
           </a>
           when Donald Trump was elected and net neutrality rules were killed.
           <b>
            However
           </b>
           , in the wake of net neutrality's federal repeal, states like California (much like
           <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200929/11162945406/eu-makes-it-clear-that-zero-rating-violates-net-neutrality.shtml">
            the EU
           </a>
           ) passed their own net neutrality rules that genuinely prohibit zero rating.
          </p>
          <p>
           More specifically, California's rules prohibited a company like AT&amp;T from taking money from, say, ESPN, to exempt
           <em>
            just
           </em>
           ESPN content from caps. Why? One, again, caps are bogus artificial constructs that serve no technical function. And two, if a deep-pocketed giant like ESPN can afford to bypass your pointless cellular restrictions, and smaller online sports website can't, ESPN just gained an unfair competitive advantage (once AT&amp;T gets its slice of the pie, of course).
          </p>
          <p>
           AT&amp;T, as you might expect, doesn't like this loss of revenue and power (the only two things this has ever been about for them). As such, the company took to their policy blog this week to
           <a href="https://www.attpublicpolicy.com/congress/impact-of-california-net-neutrality-law-on-free-data-services/?source=email">
            whine incessantly about how unfair this all is
           </a>
           . The company says that as a result of the rules it's backing off its "sponsored data" zero rating plan not just in California, but in other states. It will also no longer let companies buy cap-exempt, "zero rated" status. That's a good thing for internet competition, startups, innovation, and consumers. But this being AT&amp;T, of course the company claims the exact opposite:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <em>
            <p>
             "Since it began, our sponsored data service, and competing offers from other wireless providers, have delivered significant benefits and saved consumers money. Consumers also have enjoyed an explosion of video streaming services."
            </p>
           </em>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Again though, you're not providing "significant benefits" by creating entirely arbitrary restrictions then letting the wealthiest companies pay you more to bypass them. You're creating a new business paradigm where you inject telecom giants into the mix to determine who can or can't be the most successful. Caps aren't based on any technical necessity, and they don't
           <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2014/10/analysis-wireless-data-caps-more-about-profit-than-congestion/">
            really help manage network congestion
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           Here in the States, large ISPs have done a
           <b>
            great
           </b>
           job confusing the press and public by claiming that zero rating is the bits and bytes equivalent of a
           <a href="https://about.att.com/newsroom/introducing_sponsored_data_for_mobile_data_subscribers_and_businesses_jan.html">
            1-800 number for data
           </a>
           or

            free shipping
           </a>
           . Customers who don't understand that usage caps are arbitrary nonsense from the get go often buy into this idea that they're getting something for free. Industry loyal regulators like Ajit Pai intentionally compound this confusion by claiming that this model is somehow of immense benefit to low income communities.
          </p>
          <p>
           Except that's not true. In fact data has shown zero rating
           <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/88ayjp/atandt-cries-about-having-to-play-fair-under-new-net-neutrality-law">
            drives up consumer costs where it's heavily adopted:
           </a>
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <em>
            <p>
             "AT&amp;T and industry-friendly regulators like Ajit Pai have also tried to claim that “zero rating” helps make broadband more affordable. But van Schewick said data has clearly shown that consumers pay notably more for broadband access in countries that embrace the practice.

             than ISPs that zero-rate video,” van Schewick said. “In announcing this shutdown, AT&amp;T is trying to score political points against state net neutrality protections by lying to the public about the law and its effects."
            </p>
           </em>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Meanwhile, AT&amp;T also continues to complain about how a "patchwork" of net neutrality rules is "totally unworkable," despite the fact this is the
           <u>
            direct result of their successful fifteen year lobbying quest
           </u>
           to not only kill net neutrality, but lobotomize the FCC:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <em>
            <p>
             "A state-by-state approach to “net neutrality” is unworkable. A patchwork of state regulations, many of them overly restrictive, creates roadblocks to creative and pro-consumer solutions. We have long been committed to the principles of an open Internet."
            </p>
           </em>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           It takes a fair amount of hubris to repeatedly whine about a problem your lobbyists created. AT&amp;T also continues to proclaim that this is an issue that should be settled by Congress passing a net neutrality law, hoping you'll ignore that it pays US lawmakers oodles of money to
           <b>
            not
           </b>
           do this. Yeah, AT&amp;T wants a federal net neutrality law, but it wants one
           <em>
            its lawyers write
           </em>
           . One that's filled with loopholes and, most importantly, pre-empts tougher, better state or federal consensus driven solutions that might actually have some teeth.

           Cricut -- the leading brand of
           <a href="https://craftindustryalliance.org/can-cricut-innovative-ways-use-cutting-machine/">
            home use CNC machines
           </a>
           -- has decided to alienate the people you'd think it would most want to embrace: its paying customers. Cricut machines allow users to upload designs and put their machines to work cutting materials from paper to cloth to metal to whatever will fit into the machines, giving hobbyists and craftmakers control of a small-scale manufacturing operation. They're pretty amazing. And they're pretty expensive.
          </p>
          <p>
           They're also subject to a whole lot of rules -- some written and some unwritten. Cricut has made efforts to lock competitors out of the market
           <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120224084644/http://die-cutting-machines-review.toptenreviews.com/cricut-expression-review.html">
            by limiting cutting tool compatibility
           </a>
           and restricting sheet size to increase sales of its own line of Cricut raw materials. Most designer paper comes in a standard 8.5" x 11" size. Sheet size in Cricuts
           <a href="https://twitter.com/VeemonTamer/status/1370608302112043008">
            is limited to 6.75" x 9.25"
           </a>
           , meaning off-the-rack, non-Circut-branded papers are about 20% useless.
          </p>
          <p>
           Things like this help Cricut make the most of its multiple revenue streams. Cricut has apparently decided it has at least one too few revenue streams. As Hackaday reports,
           <a href="https://hackaday.com/2021/03/15/cricut-decides-to-charge-rent-for-people-to-use-the-cutting-machines-they-already-own/">
            the company is now asking customers who've purchased printers to start paying the company in exchange for the privilege of fully utilizing their purchases
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <blockquote>
           <p>
            <em>
             [Cricut] has dropped a bombshell
             <a href="https://inspiration.cricut.com/new-features-and-updates-coming-to-design-space/">
              in the form of an update
             </a>
             to the web-based design software that leaves
             <a href="https://twitter.com/VeemonTamer/status/1370608296726499333">
              their now very annoyed users
             </a>
             with a monthly upload limit of 20 new designs unless they sign up for a Cricut Access Plan that costs $9.99 on monthly payments. Worse still, a screenshot is circulating online purporting to be from
             <a href="https://twitter.com/procrastiranger/status/1370925884631289861">
              a communication with a Cricut employee
             </a>
             attempting to clarify matters, in which it is suggested that machines sold as second-hand will be bricked by the company.
            </em>
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
           Well, that's at least two levels of suck contained in a single announcement. First, the decision to hit people who've already shelled out hundreds or thousands to Cricut with perpetual fees is inexplicable. Cricut isn't the only cutter
           <a href="https://freshlypickedblog.com/cricut-alternatives/">
            on the market
           </a>
           and a move like this just talks loyal users out of their loyalty and encourages them to explore their options. In exchange for smaller fees, Cricut seems willing to watch thousands of dollars exit the market for their competitors.
          </p>
          <p>
           Second, the bricking of secondhand devices is pure bullshit. A Cricut is a Cricut. Anyone who bought one should have the right to sell it. And anyone buying one from a former user should rightfully expect it will be fully functional, not bricked by a company willing to compound its errors.
          </p>
          <p>
           Fortunately, the company has listened to its users.
           <a href="https://twitter.com/VeemonTamer/status/1371931382209945601">
            It has dropped the rent program
           </a>
           and said that anyone who buys a cutter before the end of this year will be grandfathered into the
           <a href="https://inspiration.cricut.com/new-features-and-updates-coming-to-design-space/">
            existing unlimited free program
           </a>
           . Buyers who purchase one after December 31, 2021 will apparently be expected to purchase a subscription, which means
           <a href="https://www.change.org/p/cricut-listen-up">
            this mini-debacle
           </a>
           will be revisited later this year if Cricut refuses to drop its subscription program completely.
          </p>
          <p>
           Cricut has also clarified that it's not moving forward with a plan to brick secondhand machines. New users will need to set up their own accounts, but the machines will function as normal.
          </p>
          <p>
           All's well that ends well, I guess. But anyone outside of Cricut could have informed Cricut how this was going to play out. Chances are, some people inside Cricut realized that as well, but were overridden by those willing to ask what the market was willing to absorb, even if it meant shedding a few more reputation points.
