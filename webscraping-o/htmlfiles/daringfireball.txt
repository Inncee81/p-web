        Pathetic. So sad. This campaign (which feels utterly unconnected
to the Seinfeld spots) might as well be titled “Please stop making
fun of Windows, Apple.” […]
       </p>
       <p>
        Directly responding to Apple’s campaign is weak. It’s playing
Pepsi to Apple’s Coke, Burger King to Apple’s McDonald’s. It’s an
explicit acknowledgement that Microsoft is the second-place brand.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       In hindsight, I see how the ads were a tacit acknowledgement that they’d dug themselves a hole to climb out of with Windows Vista. Much stronger ads than Intel’s this week — I really doubt there will be any nostalgia for this Intel campaign a decade from now.

       Yours truly, yesterday

      :
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       To my recollection, Apple never once advertised that its
Intel-based Macs were Intel-based. They definitely mentioned it on
stage during new Mac hardware product introductions (starting with
Steve Jobs calling then-Intel-CEO Paul Otellini on stage, wearing
a bunny suit, at Macworld Expo in January 2006 to help introduce
the first ones. But they never ran ads that mentioned Intel,
unless I’m forgetting them.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      So much for my recollection. A few kind readers reminded me that right at the outset, in January 2006, just after unveiling the first Intel-based Macs, Apple debuted a commercial entirely about the Mac’s move. The ad was even titled “The Intel Chip”.
     </p>

      Here’s
      <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2006/01/mwsf_2006#the-intel-chip-ad">
       what I wrote at the time
      </a>

        “Intel chip”
commercial
       </a>
       Apple unveiled at the show.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lighting, the extreme slow-motion cinematography, the

       </a>
       ,
the words — the ad is beautiful. It has a Kubrickian vibe that
warms my heart. This is TV-commercial-as-art.
      </p>
      <p>
       Intel, however, is feigning displeasure at the ad’s message:
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Intel chip. For years, it’s been trapped inside PCs. Dull
little boxes, dutifully performing dull little tasks. When it could
have been doing so much more.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding Intel’s reaction to the ad,
       <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/intel-our-other-customers-arent-boring/">
        CNet’s Ina Fried
reported
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Never would we characterize our customers that way,” Intel Vice
President Deborah Conrad said in an interview.
       </p>
       <p>
        Conrad said that Intel cooperated with Apple for some particulars
of the TV spot, but added, “We didn’t know what the end result
was going to be.” The company did get a peek at the ad before
Tuesday’s keynote, but it wasn’t too much earlier.
       </p>
       <p>
        “It’s probably a good thing that we didn’t see them earlier,”
Conrad said.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Don’t believe it. Intel
       <em>
        loves
       </em>
       this ad. This ad makes Intel
processors look better than any ad Intel has ever produced itself.
The feeling this ad conveys is that Intel’s chips are going to be
kicking some goddamn major ass inside Macs.
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      Really hard to believe I didn’t recall this ad yesterday.
      <sup id="fnr1-2021-03-18">
       <a href="#fn1-2021-03-18">

       </a>
      </sup>
      I blame the fact that I was trying to think of ads about specific Macs that
      <em>
       mentioned
      </em>
      Intel — and completely overlooked one of my favorite commercials ever, because it was entirely about the Intel partnership itself.
     </p>
     <p>
      The message was that the two great companies of the industry were finally together: Apple, the product maker, and Intel, the chip maker. 15 years later, though, I can kind of see how Intel might have been a bit peeved. It paints Intel as needing the Mac for its chips to reach their potential, not the Mac as needing Intel chips to achieve performance-per-watt parity with the rest of the PC industry. It’s implicitly a bit insulting, and an utterly Jobsian way to frame the new partnership. It’s hard to imagine Intel having made a converse ad: “
      <em>
       The Macintosh. For years, it’s been saddled with inferior chips. Beautiful little boxes, dutifully chugging along. When they could have been running so much faster.
      </em>
      ” Pretty sure an ad like that would have gotten Steve Jobs on the phone with Paul Otellini.
     </p>
     <p>
      But I stand by the claim that Apple’s ad makes Intel chips look better,
      <em>
       feel
      </em>
      better — downright epic, even — than any ad Intel itself had ever made or has made since. The visuals are clinical, but the message is all heart and soul.
     </p>
     <hr/>
     <p>
      Which brings me to my bigger complaint with Intel’s new
      <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk2sjg_-F-MfQL0aUbKyDX909ZfKCUq1c">
       “Go PC” campaign
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Intel is in trouble. For Intel to be
      <em>
       Intel
      </em>
      they need to be leading the industry. The best fabs, the fastest chips. Right now they can’t credibly argue that they’re the best
      <em>
       at anything
      </em>
      . They haven’t just lost the Mac. TSMC is absolutely killing them at fabrication. All modern smartphones are built on ARM chips. Intel tried to gain a foothold in the cellular modem business,
      <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/12/01/intel-qualcomm">
       and failed
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      <a href="https://youtu.be/8HebkohrCns">
       One of the spots
      </a>
      in Intel’s new campaign is focused on “PC gaming”, but Intel isn’t even a leader there.
      <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/features/amd-vs-intel-cpus">
       AMD’s Ryzen CPUs are the current gamers’ choice
      </a>
      . Gaming GPUs? Forget about it — Nvidia is king and AMD is a credible player, but Intel isn’t really in the game. They have no footprint in the console gaming industry — the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series all use AMD CPUs
      <em>
       and
      </em>
      GPUs. The Nintendo Switch uses an ARM SoC from Nvidia.
     </p>
     <p>
      Intel’s marketing is now high on their own supply. Instead of thinking “Intel Inside” was a badge of honor because it meant leading edge tech was powering the device, they think it’s necessarily good tech inside because the Intel badge is outside. They’re advertising like they’re still perched atop Relevancy Mountain when the obvious truth everyone can see is how startlingly far they’ve fallen from that peak. They need to

      .

     <p>
      If Intel wants to start a new era,

      , no less — they’re drawing inspiration from the wrong old Apple campaign. Intel needs their version of “
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sMBhDv4sik">
       Think Different
      </a>
      ”. Reassert the company’s core values. Tell the world, and your own employees, how they should
      <em>
       feel
      </em>
      about Intel. I don’t know what that message is, but Intel needs to figure it out. “Go PC” sure isn’t it.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The company is planning a refresh to its iPad Pro line, adding a
better processor and improved cameras, the people said. The new
models will look similar to the current iPad Pros and come in the
same 11-inch and 12.9-inch screen sizes. The devices will have an
updated processor that is on par with the faster M1 chip in the
latest MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac mini. Apple designs these
processors itself and typically has them made by Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It’s worth remembering that Apple never shipped A13-based iPad Pros. They went from
       <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/03/the_2020_ipad_pros">
        the A12X in November 2018
       </a>
       to
       <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/03/the_2020_ipad_pros">
        an A12Z speed bump one year ago
       </a>
       — and the difference between the A12X and A12Z is just one extra GPU core (from 7 to 8). I suspect the new chip in the new iPad Pros will be called the A14X, not the M-something. But performance-wise they should be very close. The names are just marketing, and “M” means Mac.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Apple is also looking to include a Mini-LED screen with at least
the larger model, which would be brighter and have improved
contrast ratios.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They’re getting announced in two weeks but Apple is “looking to include Mini-LED”. They’d better make a decision soon.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In testing, the new iPad Pros have used a Thunderbolt connector,
the same port on the latest Macs with custom Apple processors. The
port doesn’t require new chargers, but it would enable
connectivity with additional external monitors, hard drives and
other peripherals. It’s also faster at syncing data than the USB-C
technology used in the current models.

compelling choice available with PCs?” said John Coyne, Intel’s vp
of brand, creative and media. “Who better to help us tell that
story than Justin Long, who spent more than four years and 66
commercials representing the personification of ‘I’m a Mac’?”

      I’m sure some will claim to find
      <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLk2sjg_-F-MfQL0aUbKyDX909ZfKCUq1c">
       this ad campaign
      </a>
      to be a sick burn. I find it cringey, and kind of hard to watch. It’s neither parody nor sequel. It’s an attempt at comedy from writers who have no sense of humor. The concept isn’t actually anything beyond “
      <em>
       Let’s hire Justin Long as our new pitchman, that’ll show them.
      </em>
      ” One gets the feeling, early on, that there was an uncomfortable phone call to Justin Long from his agent that began, “Before you say ‘no’, at least let me tell you how much money they’re offering.” The concept wouldn’t really work with anyone other than Justin Long. (Did Intel make an offer to John Hodgman? Does Long hold a grudge that he didn’t get called back to appear in
      <a href="https://youtu.be/5AwdkGKmZ0I?t=2707">
       the M1 event after-credits scene
      </a>
      ?)
     </p>
     <p>
      The spots start, briefly, in a white void, like the original Apple campaign, with Long starting with his iconic “Hello, I’m a…” but interrupting himself to say “… Justin, just a real person doing a real comparison.” Just enough of a touch of momentary parody to hammer home that the “I’m a Mac” guy is now pitching for Intel, but nowhere near enough to be conceptually clever. And then all of a sudden he walks into… a living room?
     </p>
     <p>
      The truly weird thing is that Justin Long was always pitching for Intel-based computers, at least indirectly,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_a_Mac">
       in the “Get a Mac” campaign
      </a>
      , the introduction of which coincided with the start of the Intel Mac era: 2006-2009.
     </p>
     <p>
      To my recollection, Apple never once advertised that its Intel-based Macs were Intel-based. They definitely mentioned it on stage during new Mac hardware product introductions (starting with Steve Jobs calling then-Intel-CEO Paul Otellini on stage, wearing a bunny suit,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp49Tmmtmf8">
       at Macworld Expo in January 2006 to help introduce the first ones
      </a>
      ). But they never ran ads that mentioned Intel, unless I’m forgetting them. Maybe they had print ads which mentioned specs? But the whole reason Intel is able to make marketing hay today over Justin Long starring in ads telling people
      <em>
       not
      </em>
      to buy a Mac is that Apple never emphasized that the Macs Justin Long did pitch a decade ago all had Intel chips.
     </p>
     <p>
      Likewise, I don’t believe Intel has ever mentioned Apple or the Mac in TV commercials before these new spots. Prior to 2006, they didn’t have to (and by the mid-2000s were actively courting Apple’s business). But post-2006, I’m guessing they weren’t able to. Apple didn’t want Intel emphasizing that the guts of a Mac were no different than Windows PCs — a broad generalization, I know, but basically true when it came to raw CPU system performance. And it’s not like Intel was going to throw shade at any of its “regular” PC customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Compare and contrast with the massive co-marketing campaigns Apple does with iPhone cellular carriers like AT&amp;T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. Apple runs its own iPhone ads (billboards, magazines, TV) with carrier logos — partially paid for by the carrier, and the carriers are permitted (presumably with Apple’s ad-by-ad approval, but I don’t know) to run
      <a href="https://adage.com/creativity/work/chris-rock-reminisces-about-slowness-life-apple-iphone-12-and-verizon-5g/2287771">
       their own ads
      </a>
      with iPhone-specific promotions. Apple’s iPhone carrier partnerships are much more partner-y than its relationship with Intel ever was.
     </p>
     <p>
      So one of my takeaways from this new “Go PC: Justin Gets Real” campaign is that it highlights just how unusual Apple’s relationship with Intel has been. The Mac was an Intel-based platform — not just x86 but Intel chips specifically — for 15 years, yet neither company ever advertised it.
     </p>
     <p>
      Messaging-wise, these new spots are just a litany of the same talking points we’ve been hearing from PC makers and Microsoft for the last few years — that PC laptops offer things you can’t get on a Mac: touch screens, detachable screens, and stickers on the palm rests.

       Intel’s gaming spot
      </a>
      is the most interesting, because it feels the most fair. Gaming is a legitimate advantage for PCs. In the ad, Long approaches a (slightly surly, to be honest) young man who is playing a racing game on a PC laptop. You can tell he’s a gamer because he’s wearing Razer headphones and sitting in a cool chair. “You’re doing all this gaming on a laptop?” Then: “Do we have a Mac here?” and the camera pans to a lonely MacBook at an empty desk with an uncool chair. “Pff, no one really games on a Mac” our gamer tells Long.
     </p>
     <p>
      That’s sort of a weird thing for Intel to be bragging about, given that the Mac just spent 15 years on Intel’s chip architecture. Bragging about PC gaming versus Mac gaming would make a lot more sense coming from Microsoft (because of Windows, the OS the games run on) or Nvidia (because of their video cards,
      <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/nvidia/apple-cuda-toolkit-support">
       which Apple famously doesn’t use
      </a>
      ). Apple’s relationship with Intel is so fresh that most of the pro-level Mac models Apple sells today are still Intel-based. We talk about it in the past tense but it’s like a divorce where one of the spouses still hasn’t moved most of their stuff out of the apartment. It’s almost enough to make you think that being on Intel didn’t do much for the Mac, gaming-wise, and that whatever the reasons for the Mac’s position as a relative afterthought in gaming, it has a lot more to do with MacOS vs. Windows than CPU chip architecture.
     </p>
     <p>
      And it’s even worse when you consider that in the PC gaming space,
      <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/features/amd-vs-intel-cpus">
       Intel is losing the CPU race to AMD
      </a>
      . Nvidia is the champion in the GPU space, but AMD is at least a player, a contender in that market. Intel’s video cards? It’s embarrassing. I don’t think it’s a stretch to wonder whether the Mac will occupy a stronger gaming position in the Apple Silicon future — where Apple can build off iOS’s gaming success — than they did while the Mac was Intel-based and the best way to run many games on Mac hardware was to install Windows. And this gaming argument is the strongest point Intel has.
     </p>
     <p>
      When you get into the details of Apple’s move away from Intel, it doesn’t look good for Intel. These Intel ads make it feel like the Mac was always excluded from Intel’s platform, like the 15-year Intel Mac era didn’t happen (let alone the fact that it still hasn’t closed). When in fact the truth is that Apple could have stayed on Intel for as long as they wanted, and instead
      <em>
       chose
      </em>
      to spend the last 10 years building up their own chip designs so they could leave Intel behind. Apple’s not moving the Mac from Intel to its own chips because it was the easier path.
     </p>
     <p>
      So, who are these ads for? (That’s generally a good question to ask about any ads.) With Apple’s original Get a Mac campaign, the target audience was clear: Windows PC users who were open to the idea of switching to the Mac. Get people to try a Mac — that was the point. The point of these ads feels entirely defensive, reactionary even:
      <em>
       Don’t switch
      </em>
      .

       Shaan Puri’s Bear Case Against Clubhouse

       Shaan Puri, in a breezy, fun thread on Twitter:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        So… everyone seems to think clubhouse is the “next big thing”
- but I think it’s going to fail. Here’s how I think it all
goes down.
       </p>
       <p>
        (Disclaimer - I don’t
        <em>
         want
        </em>
        clubhouse to fail. The world is more
fun if it wins… but wanting something doesn’t mean it’s going to
happen. If it did, then guac would be default included inside every
bag of chips.)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It’s devilishly hard to predict how something popular and growing might eventually peter out. I think Puri is onto something about the limits of Clubhouse’s potential appeal after they run out of early adopters. One factor that’s hard to gauge, but comes up frequently, is the effect of our quarantine on Clubhouse’s appeal. To some degree it seems certain that Clubhouse is at least a little more popular than it would be (or will be) in a world where we’re not all starved for normal social interaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there are some things Clubhouse has going for it that don’t seem to get talked about. One is serendipity. It’s a defining constraint of the platform that everything is live. But that can be a feature, too. Don’t forget that tens of millions of people watch live TV every day. Sometimes, some people just want to turn on the TV and find something, anything, to grab their attention. I think Clubhouse brings something like that to our phones.

       Andrew Ross Sorkin, writing for The New York Times:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is fair to say that we socialized the airline industry’s losses
and largely privatized the gains.
       </p>
       <p>
        No other industry affected by the pandemic received more from the
government. There was no special program for hotels or restaurants
or travel agencies. Companies in those industries had to line up
for the small business-focused Paycheck Protection Program and
pray. The largest loan the program could make was $10 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The question isn’t whether airline employees should have been
helped, it’s whether airline shareholders should have been. The
airline bailouts weren’t simply a job-protection program, as
advertised. In case you’re not convinced, there’s this: United
invested $20 million into an electric helicopter company last
month that went public through a special purpose acquisition
company, or SPAC. Does that sound like a company that is in such
dire straits that it requires a taxpayer-funded bailout? It
received a third rescue payment after it made the investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the stock market now soaring, it is worth considering whether
the airlines needed taxpayer money at all.

        my previous item
       </a>
       . Sorkin points out that a big part of the “privatized profits” is that when business is good, the airlines pump their profits into stock buybacks, rather than saving for a rainy day (or pandemic year). Restaurants don’t have that option — they run on tight margins and generally slim profits even when business is good.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, there are big airline-size corporations that run massive restaurant chains. A bailout that focused on privately-held restaurants would have been one way to start.

      <blockquote>

        Agency is hard enough to come by in daily life, but in a pandemic
that’s made it clear just how little of it we actually have,
choosing how to spend money becomes a compelling stand-in. It
seems inevitable now that the choices available to even the most
ethically minded diners have largely been consumer choices: Buy
restaurant merch and gift cards. Get takeout and tip
extravagantly. Avoid third-party delivery apps if possible. Dine
outside. Eat at home.
       </p>
       <p>
        But underneath every available option is the one terrible choice
the government constructed for all of us: Engage with restaurants
or watch the industry disappear. This is the wrong ultimatum,
however, and one that only reinforces two distinct yet related
axioms of American restaurant culture — that customers ought to
have authority over workers, and that those workers matter less
than their customers.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       We have leaned toward “get takeout and tip extravagantly”, but it’s tough. Even making a conscientious effort to support our favorite restaurants, we’ve spent only a fraction of what we usually spend over the last year. It’s been a hard year for so many businesses, but it’s hard to not think that we, collectively, have most failed our restaurant industry. We even call it “hospitality”. How can you be hospitable during a frighteningly contagious and dangerous pandemic?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        After 4 years on the market, Apple has discontinued its original HomePod. It says that it will continue to produce and focus on the HomePod mini, introduced last year. The larger HomePod offered a beefier sound space but the mini has been very well received and clearly accomplishes many of the duties that the larger version was tasked with. The sound is super solid (especially for the size) and it offers access to Siri, Apple’s assistant feature.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I love my HomePods, but clearly the market deemed them too expensive. I think part of the problem is that the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       HomePod experience is having two of them paired — they sound more than twice as good as a single HomePod. So to get the real HomePod experience, it’s $600 (and used to be $700).

       The Associated Press:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A structural engineer who trained at the prestigious Technical
University in Delft, he joined Philips in 1952 and was head of the
company’s product development department when he began work on an
alternative for existing tape recorders with their cumbersome
large spools of tape.
       </p>
       <p>
        His goal was simple: making tapes and their players far more
portable and easier to use.
       </p>
       <p>
        “During the development of the cassette tape, in the early 1960s,
he had a wooden block made that fit exactly in his coat pocket,”
said Olga Coolen, director of the Philips Museum in the southern
city of Eindhoven. “This was how big the first compact cassette
was to be, making it a lot handier than the bulky tape recorders
in use at the time.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The final product created in 1962 later turned into a worldwide
hit, with more than 100 billion cassettes sold, many to music fans
who would record their own compilations direct from the radio. Its
popularity waned with the arrival of the compact disc, an
invention Ottens also helped create as supervisor of a development
team, Philips said.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Cassette tapes were a huge part of my youth. That’s how I listened to music, and, because you could easily record on them, that’s how I collected my own music. You could listen to the radio on your boom box (I had a classic Panasonic that looked a
       <em>
        lot

       like
       <a href="/misc/2021/03/panasonic.jpeg">
        this one
       </a>
       ) and when a song you liked came out, you could record it. When you caught a hit song with a tape ready to go, it was like winning a little jackpot. Cassette tapes were empowering and fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       In high school I bought a Sony Walkman that I recall cost a bit north of $100. It was a Sports model, one of the rugged yellow ones, and it offered what to me then sounded like amazing bass, and a digital FM tuner that was a game changer for getting a perfect signal.
       <a href="https://twitter.com/cdespinosa/status/1370214338896613379">
        There’s a direct line from cassette tapes to iPods

       and the modern world of streaming.

      <p>
       I spent a fortune on CDs when I went to college, but I don’t have the reverent nostalgia for CDs that I do for cassette tapes. (Cassettes were even part of computing — my elementary school had a few

       Josh Centers, writing for The Prepared:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A “pro tip” for evaluating the quality of a piece of gear is to
look at the small details, such as zippers and stitching.
Cheap-minded manufacturers will skimp on those details because
most people just don’t notice, and even a cheap component will
often last past a basic warranty period, so it’s an easy way to
increase profits without losing sales or returns.
       </p>
       <p>
        If a designer does bother to invest in quality components, that’s
a tried-and-true sign that the overall product is better than the
competition. Zippers are a classic example when looking at
backpacks, clothing, and similar gear. And although there are a
few other fine zipper brands out there, the king is
        <a href="https://ykknorthamerica.com/">
         YKK Group
        </a>
        — to the point that the first thing some gear reviewers look for is
the “YKK” branding on the zipper pull tab.
       </p>
       <p>
        My dad used to do some work for YKK back in the ‘90s, so I wanted
to dig deeper into why they’re the king and what makes their
zippers so associated with quality.

      <p>
       Centers quotes a remark
       <a href="https://recycledfirefighter.com/blogs/news/why-are-ykk-zippers-good">
        from a post by Recycled Firefighter
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        YKK Zippers are amazing, because they self-lubricate the more you
use them. You’ll notice that other brands of zippers become sticky
and gritty over time. Not with YKK… They will feel more smooth,
the more you use them.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I have a hoodie from American Giant that’s a few years old now, and the zipper no longer stays up. It’s not a YKK. I also have a slightly newer hoodie from them — same size — and the zipper always stays up, and, I have noticed, just has a better feel. It’s a YKK.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        You probably think of Amazon as the largest online bookstore.
Amazon helped make e-books popular with the Kindle, now the
dominant e-reader. Less well known is that since 2009, Amazon has
published books and audiobooks under its own brands including
        <a href="https://amazonpublishing.amazon.com/lake-union-publishing.html">
         Lake Union

        and
        <a href="https://www.audiblestudios.com/">
         Audible
        </a>
        . Amazon is a beast
with many tentacles: It’s got the store, the reading devices and,
increasingly, the words that go on them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Librarians have been no match for the beast. When authors sign up
with a publisher, it decides how to distribute their work. With
other big publishers, selling e-books and audiobooks to libraries
is part of the mix — that’s why you’re able to digitally check
out bestsellers like Barack Obama’s “A Promised Land.” Amazon is
the only big publisher that flat-out blocks library digital
collections. Search your local library’s website, and you won’t
find recent e-books by Amazon authors Kaling, Dean Koontz or Dr.
Ruth Westheimer. Nor will you find downloadable audiobooks for
Trevor Noah’s “Born a Crime,” Andy Weir’s “The Martian” and
Michael Pollan’s “Caffeine.”

       Apple v. Simon Lancaster, filed today in United States district court in California:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Plaintiff Apple Inc. (“Apple”) brings this action to stop the
misappropriation of Apple’s trade secrets by its former employee
Simon Lancaster.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite over a decade of employment at Apple, Lancaster abused his
position and trust within the company to systematically
disseminate Apple’s sensitive trade secret information in an
effort to obtain personal benefits. He used his seniority to gain
access to internal meetings and documents outside the scope of his
job’s responsibilities containing Apple’s trade secrets, and he
provided these trade secrets to his outside media correspondent
(“Correspondent”). The Correspondent then published the stolen
trade secrets in articles, citing a “source” at Apple. On multiple
occasions, Lancaster proposed that the Correspondent give benefits
to Lancaster in exchange for Apple’s trade secrets. For example,
Lancaster proposed that the Correspondent provide favorable
coverage of a startup company in which Lancaster was an investor
as a quid pro quo. Lancaster even recruited the Correspondent to
serve as his personal investigator. In one instance, Lancaster
requested that the Correspondent explore a rumor that could prove
harmful to a company in which Lancaster had invested. […]
       </p>
       <p>
        On October 10, 2019, the Correspondent requested additional
confidential information from Lancaster related to another
unannounced Apple project referred to herein as “Project X.”
       </p>
       <p>
        On October 15, 2019, Lancaster submitted his resignation to Apple,
and he began off-boarding from his roles within the company. […]
On October 16, 2019, the Correspondent asked Lancaster “can you
grab me those docs before you leave”? Lancaster responded “which
ones,” and the Correspondent then identified specific Apple
confidential documents that they wanted Lancaster to
misappropriate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Later that month, Lancaster informed the Correspondent that he
intended to attend a meeting regarding Project X. […] Prior to
the time Lancaster attended the Project X meeting, he was
instructed by Apple that he should not attend the meeting,
especially given his announced departure. Additional Apple
personnel told Lancaster during the meeting that he should not be
present. Lancaster eventually left the meeting, but he learned
substantial SAI regarding Project X before leaving. Lancaster
wrote to one of his managers who had instructed him that he should
not be in the meeting that “I had already been exposed to all the
hardware they showed while I was in the [meeting]. Was just hoping
to see a demo.” On information and belief, this communication by
Lancaster was intended to disguise his efforts to misappropriate
Apple trade secrets regarding Project X.
       </p>
       <p>
        On information and belief, Lancaster transmitted the trade secret
SAI gleaned from this meeting to the Correspondent on the same day
the meeting occurred. […]
       </p>
       <p>
        November 1, 2019 was Lancaster’s final day of employment at Apple
and his credentials to log into the secure Apple corporate network
were set to expire at midnight. But at 10:24 p.m. that same day,
Lancaster used his credentials to log onto Apple’s secure
corporate network from a location outside Apple facilities. On
information and belief, Lancaster used this access to download
additional SAI before his login credentials expired. In
particular, Lancaster downloaded confidential information that
would assist his new employer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere days after Lancaster’s final day at Apple, Lancaster had a
call with the Correspondent and later congratulated the
Correspondent about the success of an article that disclosed SAI
that Lancaster had misappropriated in his final weeks of
employment at Apple.

attempt to succeed where Google Glass failed years ago. The
glasses are expected to synchronize with a wearer’s iPhone to
display things such as texts, emails, maps, and games over the
user’s field of vision. The company has considered including an
App Store with the headset, as it does on Apple TV streaming
devices and the Apple Watch. It’s hiring experts in graphics and
game development to establish the glasses as the leader in a new
product category and, if all goes perfectly, an eventual successor
to the iPhone.

       <p>
        The key correspondence comes from December 28, 2020, between
Tesla’s associate general counsel Eric C. Williams and California
DMV’s chief of the autonomous vehicles branch, Miguel D. Acosta. A
letter details the capabilities of both Autopilot and FSD:
“Currently neither Autopilot nor FSD Capability is an autonomous
system, and currently no comprising feature, whether singularly or
collectively, is autonomous or makes our vehicles autonomous,”
Williams states.

        Apple Podcasts will no longer use the word “subscribe” in a few
weeks.
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s3SSIQOlqI">
         Listeners will be invited to “follow” their favourite
podcasts instead
        </a>
        . The new wording will be in iOS 14.5, which
should be released later this month (and is available in beta). We
expect Apple to communicate further with creators, and listeners,
when this version of iOS is released.
       </p>
       <p>
        This seemingly small change could dramatically affect the
industry. Tom Webster from Edison Research
        <a href="https://podnews.net/update/follow-not-subscribe">
         says 47% of people who
don’t currently listen to podcasts think that ‘subscribing’ to a
podcast will cost money
        </a>
        , describing it as a stone in the shoe
of podcasting’s growth run. He tells Podnews: “Today, Apple,
Spotify, and YouTube are the three most widely used services to
play podcasts, and now the word Subscribe means ‘automatically
download for free’ in exactly none of them. Podcasters will have
no choice but to adapt their language accordingly or risk
confusing listeners.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Other larger podcast apps have already changed: Spotify and
Audible use “follow”, Stitcher uses “+ follow”, and Amazon Music
uses “♡ follow”. Meanwhile, Google Podcasts and Castbox use “+
Subscribe”, and Overcast and Castro uses “Subscribe”.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I think I like this change. It clarifies what’s free and what’s paid using common words. It removes confusion from a service that wants to both sell access to paid podcasts
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       allow users to sign up for regular old-fashioned free podcasts.
       <em>
        And
       </em>
       it removes confusion for users who hear the word
       <em>
        subscribe
       </em>
       and think it implies
       <em>
        paid

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Apple’s 30/70 split with developers is steep, but initial reaction
from the developers I follow on Twitter seems to be positive. Paul
Kafasis of
        <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/">
         Rogue Amoeba
        </a>
        told me via IM, “70%? That’s…
that’s… livable,” which seems to sum up the consensus sentiment. […]
       </p>
       <p>
        In short, what developers lose per-transaction from Apple’s 30
percent take, they can more than make up for in volume. This is
going to be a gold rush.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I was correct that native apps on iPhone were going to be a huge thing, but I did not foresee how “free” apps would cripple/stunt/distort the market for selling them. The market for selling iOS apps never resembled the market for selling Mac apps pre-iPhone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling it a “gold rush” was, arguably, more right than I knew. At the time I wrote that, I meant it in the common sense of a new market where many would have the opportunity to make a fortune. But in a real-life gold rush, do
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       many people make a fortune? It certainly wasn’t the boon to indie Mac developers that I predicted.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Rogue Amoeba, for example, has
       <a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/satellite/ios/">
        a free iOS companion app for Airfoil
       </a>

        Radioshift Touch for iPhone
       </a>
       for the sky-high price of $10, but as a business, they are every bit as much a Mac developer today as they were in 2008.)

       Tyler Hayes, in an interesting story for Motherboard about Pandora:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        After Steve Jobs announced the iPhone in 2007 it became apparent
that this new internet connected, “music player,” device in
people’s pockets needed to be the future of its mobile efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        After pushback on only allowing web apps for the iPhone, Steve
Jobs announced that native apps would be coming to the iPhone. In
the interim, Apple Senior Vice President Scott Forstall invited
Tim Westergren and his CTO, Tom Conrad, over to a local Cupertino
lunch spot. The trio talked for hours about what Pandora had
learned about streaming audio from putting apps on flip phones,
like Motorola’s RAZR, for wireless carriers. The meeting ended
with a question for Forstall.
       </p>
       <p>
        “What, if anything, can we do at Pandora to get ready for the next
generation of iPhone that includes an app store and native APIs?”
asked Conrad. “Forstall said, it wouldn’t be a waste of your time
to jailbreak some iPhones and use the kind of back door toolkits
that were being distributed by other people to build a native
Pandora app while we get our act together at Apple on something
more formal.”
       </p>
       <p>
        So, Conrad, designer Dan Lythcott-Haines, and many others on the
team got to work jailbreaking iPhones and working on a Pandora
iPhone app ahead of the official APK release. Then, on day one of
the App Store launch, Pandora was the first internet radio app
available. Nine months later the Pandora app was installed on 21
percent of iPhones.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Steve Jobs announced Apple’s plans for a third-party SDK on 17 October 2007 (“
       <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/10/17/iphone-sdk">
        no permalink that I can find, alas
       </a>
       ”), and the SDK and App Store were unveiled by Jobs at a Town Hall event
       <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/1132376/liveupdate.html">
        on 6 March 2008
       </a>
       . That probably pegs this Forstall-Pandora meeting at the end of 2007, perhaps just after the SDK announcement in October. (

       Laura Edelson, Minh-Kha Nguyen, Ian Goldstein, Oana Goga, Tobias Lauinger, and Damon McCoy, in a bracing report for the Center for Cybersecurity at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Facebook has become a major way people find news and information
in an increasingly politically polarized nation. We analyzed how
users interacted with different types of posts promoted as news in
the lead-up to and aftermath of the U.S. 2020 elections. We found
that politically extreme sources tend to generate more
interactions from users. In particular, content from sources rated
as far-right by independent news rating services consistently
received the highest engagement per follower of any partisan
group. Additionally, frequent purveyors of far-right
misinformation had on average 65% more engagement per follower
than other far-right pages. We found:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Sources of news and information rated as far-right generate the
highest average number of interactions per follower with their
posts, followed by sources from the far-left, and then news
sources closer to the center of the political spectrum.
        </li>
        <li>
         Looking at the far-right, misinformation sources far outperform
non-misinformation sources. Far-right sources designated as
spreaders of misinformation had an average of 426 interactions
per thousand followers per week, while non-misinformation
sources had an average of 259 weekly interactions per thousand
followers. […]
        </li>
        <li>
         Center and left partisan categories incur a
         <em>
          misinformation
penalty
         </em>
         , while right-leaning sources do not. Center sources of
misinformation, for example, performed about 70% worse than
their non-misinformation counterparts. (Note: center sources of
misinformation tend to be sites presenting as health news that
have no obvious ideological orientation.)
        </li>
       </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That’s the basic story in a nut: It’s not the same “on both sides”. The far right has a weakness for misinformation that the rest of the political spectrum does not. From the far left to the slightly right, the NYU study shows a preference for accurate news over misinformation; it’s only the far right that prefers misinformation, and they prefer it strongly.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s not that Facebook’s leadership is pro-right-wing misinformation, but that they value engagement over all else. And if right-wing misinformation is catnip for a large audience, so be it. If it’s engaging, they push it.

        The informant’s identity was concealed for his safety. Introduced
only as “Dan,” an online video feed of Friday’s hearing was cut
off during his testimony so court observers only could hear him.
Dan described learning of the group — known as the Wolverine

       How to Enable ‘Your Watch Is Fully Charged’ Notifications in WatchOS 7 and iOS 14

     </h1>
     <h6 class="dateline">
      Monday,  8 March 2021
     </h6>
     <p>
      One of my favorite new features in WatchOS 7 and iOS 14 is an option to have your iPhone display a notification when your paired Apple Watch is fully charged. This feature was announced at WWDC 2020, and
      <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/23/ios-14-notification-apple-watch-charged/">
       Juli Clover at MacRumors wrote a story about it the next day
      </a>
      . It’s simple.
     </p>
     <p>
      I didn’t start using this feature until the fall, when I began testing an Apple Watch Series 6, which I
      <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/09/graphite_is_the_new_black">
       reviewed here
      </a>
      . Eventually, I switched from that Series 6 review unit back to my personal Apple Watch, a Series 5 I bought last year. I didn’t give it much thought until this weekend, but I stopped getting those charging notifications when I switched watches, and I couldn’t figure out why.
      <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1368259561300385805">
       So, I asked about it on Twitter
      </a>
      :
     </p>
     <blockquote>
      <p>
       When I was using my Series 6 review unit, I got these
notifications every time it charged. Now that I’m back on my own
Series 5 watch, I never get them. Anyone else not getting these
“Your watch is fully charged” notifications?
      </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p>
      A lot of people who responded in that thread were as confused as I was about the feature. But it didn’t take long to figure out what was going on. It turns out that the setting to enable these notifications is in the “Sleep” section of the Apple Watch app on your phone. That makes some sense — the idea is that the people who most need these notifications are people who are tracking their sleep with Apple Watch, and thus can’t charge their watch overnight because they’re wearing it.
     </p>
     <p>
      The problem is, if you haven’t set up your watch to track sleep in the Health app, the setting for these battery notifications doesn’t appear in the Apple Watch app. This is what the Sleep section in the Apple Watch app looks like if you have not set up Sleep in the Health app:
     </p>
     <p>
      <a class="noborder" href="/misc/2021/03/apple-watch-sleep-settings-before.jpeg">
       <img alt="Screenshot of the Sleep section of the Apple Watch app in iOS 14." src="/misc/2021/03/apple-watch-sleep-settings-before.jpeg" width="50%"/>
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      After you enable Sleep in the Health app (a multi-step process that requires going through a few screens to set sleep goals and a schedule), the Sleep section in the Apple Watch app looks like this, and the battery notification setting is obvious:
     </p>
     <p>
      <a class="noborder" href="/misc/2021/03/apple-watch-sleep-settings-after.jpeg">
       <img alt="Screenshot of the Sleep section of the Apple Watch app in iOS 14." src="/misc/2021/03/apple-watch-sleep-settings-after.jpeg" width="50%"/>
      </a>
     </p>
     <p>
      When I was testing my Series 6 review unit watch, I set all this up so I could try the new built-in sleep tracking features. I wound up not liking any of it, and I turned it all off by the time I stopped wearing the review unit. But because I had enabled Sleep tracking in Health for that watch, the option to get charging notifications remained available and enabled. I didn’t know it was there, and was only available because I had at least initially turned on Sleep in Health.
     </p>
     <p>
      When I switched back to my Series 5 watch, I never enabled Sleep in Health for that watch, because I knew I didn’t like WatchOS 7’s sleep features.

       <a href="#fn1-2021-03-08">

       </a>
      </sup>
      But the charging notifications I
      <em>
       did
      </em>
      want were never made available, because they only appear in the Apple Watch app after you enable Sleep in the Health app.
     </p>
     <p>
      After I figured this out, it was easy to start getting “fully charged” notifications from my watch again. I just turned on Sleep in Health, then disabled all the actual WatchOS 7 Sleep features, and left the option enabled for battery notifications.
     </p>
     <p>
      It’s all a bit confusing, because I don’t think it makes intuitive sense that these notifications are filed under “Sleep”. Nor that you need to set up Sleep in one app (Health) to get features enabled in another app (Apple Watch). I get why people who use the built-in Sleep features would be interested in the charging notification, but I never would have figured this out on my own. And it feels a bit convoluted that the solution involved me turning on a bunch of Sleep features I didn’t want to get a battery notification setting to appear.

         </a>
         . What I love about using Sleep++ is that it’s entirely passive. I don’t set a schedule, Sleep++ doesn’t tell me when to go to sleep, and I don’t have to do anything when I go to bed other than just wear my Apple Watch while I sleep. Sleep++ just looks at my biometric data and it figures out when I’m asleep, and sends me a simple report in the morning after I wake up.

      <blockquote>

        People who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can take fewer precautions in certain situations, including socializing indoors without masks when in the company of low-risk or other vaccinated individuals, according to

        Why it matters: The report cites early evidence that suggests vaccinated people are less likely to have asymptomatic infection, and are potentially less likely to transmit the virus to other people. At the time of its publication, the CDC said the guidance would apply to about 10% of Americans.

       My thanks to Atoms for sponsoring last week at DF. Atoms is best known for their everyday shoes. Last year, they expanded into face masks. The shoes are cool-looking and very comfortable; the masks are long-lasting and breathable, with a polyester blend outer layer and a copper-lined ionized quartz yarn inner layer offering 85 percent filtration.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the moment, though, they’re largely sold out.
      </p>
      <p>
       They’re sold out because Atoms co-founder Sidra Qasim told
       <a href="https://www.atoms.com/hony-story">
        an 11-part story
       </a>
       for

        the Instagram account Humans of New York
       </a>
       that went hyper-viral, and thousands of people who loved her story wound up at the Atoms website buying shoes. It’s a wonderful story — deeply personal, about growing up in Pakistan, building her own life and destiny, and creating a business. A tidbit, from the early days, while she and co-founder (and eventually husband) Waqas Ali were still in Pakistan:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We called our collection “Hometown Shoes.” And after we launched our website, the first order came in right away. It was from a person in France who’d been following our story on social media.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because we had no way of accepting credit cards, he sent us $85 through Western Union. It was a very big moment for us. We had finally discovered a business that would work. But our excitement only lasted until we got to FedEx, and learned that shipping would cost $120. We were torn about what to do. We considered giving the man a refund, but we had been reading so much about customer service. So we ended up shipping the shoes. It was not a promising start. We’d lost a lot of money on our very first sale.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Anyone who’s ever launched any new product can sympathize.
      </p>
      <p>
       I (and Atoms) encourage you to read her story. It’s so good. And you
       <em>
        can

       pre-order shoes and masks while they get them back in stock — orders placed now should ship by the end of April.

        hosting a copy
       </a>
       for posterity as well.) From the letter:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Although the “collaborative” process of discovery mandated by the
World Health Assembly in May 2020 was meant to enable a full
examination of the origins of the pandemic, we believe that
        <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-convened-global-study-of-the-origins-of-sars-cov-2">
         structural limitations
        </a>
        built into this endeavor make it all
but impossible for the WHO-convened mission to realize this
aspiration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on our analysis, and as confirmed
        <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/origins-of-the-virus">
         by the global study
        </a>
        convened by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Chinese
authorities, there is as yet no evidence demonstrating a fully
natural origin of this virus. The zoonosis hypothesis, largely
based on patterns of previous zoonosis events, is only one of a
number of possible SARS-CoV-2 origins, alongside the
research-related accident hypothesis.
       </p>
       <p>
        In particular, we wish to raise public awareness of the fact that
half of the joint team convened under that process is made of
Chinese citizens whose scientific independence may be limited,
that international members of the joint team had to rely on
information the Chinese authorities chose to share with them, and
that any joint team report must be approved by both the Chinese
and international members of the joint team.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have therefore reached the conclusion that the joint team did
not have the mandate, the independence, or the necessary accesses
to carry out a full and unrestricted investigation into all the
relevant SARS-CoV-2 origin hypotheses - whether natural spillover
or laboratory/research- related incident.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are also concerned that the joint team’s work has been
inaccurately reported by the media as an independent investigation
whose conclusions reflect those of the WHO. The February 9, 2021
        <a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-02-09/Live-WHO-holds-press-conference-on-scientific-research-into-COVID-19-XJv2tyicRa/index.html">
         Wuhan joint press conference
        </a>
        was a good example of this
misunderstanding. Although the findings were those of the joint
team, they were
        <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-55996728">
         widely reported as representing the WHO
itself
        </a>
        .
       </p>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A small group of scientists and others who believe the novel
coronavirus that spawned the pandemic could have originated from a
lab leak or accident is calling for an inquiry independent of the
World Health Organization’s team of independent experts sent to
China last month. […]
       </p>
       <p>
        The open letter, first reported in The Wall Street Journal and the
French publication Le Monde, lists what the signers see as flaws
in the joint W.H.O.-China inquiry, and state that it could not
adequately address the possibility that the virus leaked from a
lab. The letter further posits the type of investigation that
would be adequate, including full access to records within China. […]
       </p>
       <p>
        Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University and
one of the scientists who signed the letter, said it grew out of a
series of online discussions among scientists, policy experts and
others who came to be known informally as the Paris group. […]
He said that no one in the group thought that the virus had been
intentionally created as a weapon, but they were all convinced
that an origin in a lab through research or by accidental
infection was as likely as a spillover occurring in nature from
animals to humans.

       A lot of the “facts” people think they know about the coronavirus’s origins just aren’t true. The whole thing about the virus jumping to humans from meat sold at a Wuhan “wet market”?
       <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-did-not-jump-wuhan-market-chinese-cdc-says-2020-5">
        Not true
       </a>
       . The market was just the location of a super-spreader event. Pangolins — the scaly anteaters that were much publicized last year as the possible source?

        Now deemed unlikely

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s true there is no available evidence that COVID-19 leaked from a Wuhan lab, but there’s also no evidence that it originated zoonotically. With the original SARS coronavirus,
       <a href="https://jvi.asm.org/content/80/9/4211">
        investigators found animals suspected of spreading it to humans
       </a>
       . It is curious, to say the least, that no animal source for COVID-19 has been found. It is also suspicious, to say the least, that the Chinese government is stymying any and all attempts to investigate the Wuhan virology labs.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At least 30,000 organizations across the United States — including a significant number of small businesses, towns, cities
and local governments — have over the past few days been hacked
by an unusually aggressive Chinese cyber espionage unit that’s
focused on stealing email from victim organizations, multiple
sources tell KrebsOnSecurity. The espionage group is exploiting
four newly-discovered flaws in Microsoft Exchange Server email
software, and has seeded hundreds of thousands of victim
organizations worldwide with tools that give the attackers total,
remote control over affected systems. […]
       </p>
       <p>
        In each incident, the intruders have left behind a “web shell,” an
easy-to-use, password-protected hacking tool that can be accessed
over the Internet from any browser. The web shell gives the
attackers administrative access to the victim’s computer servers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Speaking on condition of anonymity, two cybersecurity experts
who’ve briefed U.S. national security advisors on the attack told
KrebsOnSecurity the Chinese hacking group thought to be
responsible has seized control over “hundreds of thousands” of
Microsoft Exchange Servers worldwide — with each victim system
representing approximately one organization that uses Exchange to
process email.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Microsoft Windows and Exchange have always been insecure, and probably always will be. It’s amazing how many widely-publicized hacks you can ignore if you just never use Windows or use Exchange server software.

       The cooling system of the iMac Pro is simply uncanny. I’d hold it up as the best Mac Apple made, period, of the entire Intel era. The best days for pro-level iMacs are ahead of us, though, I suspect.

       <p>
        The App Store is littered with Markdown text editors, but not all
Markdown implementations are created equal. I expect my Markdown
editor to show me every single keystroke I enter, which means any
attempt to hide hyperlinks will be met with immediate rejection.

and styling where appropriate — so that bolded text is bolded,
and headings are prominent… so long as the app doesn’t swallow the
markup that makes them so.

       Maybe I don’t know much about Markdown, but my understanding is that the whole point of it is to provide a syntax where the most common HTML tags for prose can be replaced by simple punctuation characters that are
       <em>
        meant
       </em>
       to be visible to the writer. I want to see the characters so I know I’ll get exactly the HTML output I think I’m going to get, but those punctuation characters shouldn’t distract from the readability of the prose. I created Markdown to use in
       <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">
        BBEdit
       </a>
       without any syntax coloring at all, and to this day, I do most of my Markdown editing in
       <a href="https://redsweater.com/marsedit/">
        MarsEdit
       </a>
       , which doesn’t color or style Markdown syntax at all. (It should though! Markdown is even better with some syntax coloring and styling.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea why there are now apps that use Markdown as their back end storage format but only show styled text without the Markdown source code visible.

       , for example, gets this right: they just do simple WYSIWYG editing where bold is bold, italic is italic, and links look like links and the linked URL is edited in a popup. If you want WYSIWYG, do WYSIWYG. If you want Markdown, show the Markdown. Trust me, it’s meant to be shown.
