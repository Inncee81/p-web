        Martek’s/DSM’s vegetarian-produced

       and thus, there is no heavy metal/PCB contamination as found in fish-oil
            based products and NO fish smell or taste - only the wonderful taste of a chocolate
            peanut butter cup (as in our bars), GUARANTEED! The vast majority of nutrition bars
            and protein shakes do not provide any DHA, with an occasional one providing literally
            1/8th (32 mg) of the amount of DHA we provide in a tasty, filling treats. We use
            proprietary microencapsulation of the DHA to achieve this.

      <p>
       Many believe that you can obtain the health benefits of DHA from ALA (

       cid) however, the truth is that virtually no ALA is converted
            to the critical DHA in adults (please see page 13 of the
       <a href="http://www.issfal.org/statements/pufa-recommendations/statement-5" target="_blank">

    <p><strong>How the Actilean Weight Management Program Works</strong></p>

    <p>With the Actilean Weight Management program you:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Drink five Actilean tasty, convenient meal-replacement shakes or Actilean meal
      replacement bars daily. These supply 75 grams of protein, 100% of the RDA of 24
      vitamins/minerals, and over 1,100 mg of DHA, the most critical omega-3.</li>

      <li>Eat one healthy meal and one or two snacks each day.</li>

      <li>Participate in some physical activity DAILY.</li>

      <li>Work through a new interactive lesson each week.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are no inconvenient meetings, no
    "rigid" frozen food diets, and no difficult
    exchange counting-just five tasty shakes or bars,  snacks, and a healthy meal each
    day(we'll even give you some ideas!).</p>

     <p>Of course, for those that prefer a more moderate approach to weight management, an individual
     can utilize ActiLean bars and shakes in a less regimented manner while still benefiting from both
     the excellent nutrition and fullness properties while improving their intake of DHA (omega-3).</p> -->
