      Are you ready to experience the spirit of freedom as a freelancer? Or do you get the jitters with the feeling of a rolling stone that gathers no moss? Go ahead and explore the benefits of being a freelancer and don the mantle of being your own master. Get into the self-employed module and enjoy the position of an independent contractor. Even though being a freelancer means that one is not committed to any particular company of employer, freelancer often have to sign contracts with NDAs, verbal agreements with the freelancer being entitled to charge by the hour, day, per project basis, piece rate or a value-based pricing understanding that offers quality and value for the client. Freelancer can turn bane into boon by researching the market with a professional attitude and expand the revenue aspect. Being a freelancer does not entitle one to enjoying healthcare provision, pension and tax exemptions. Therefore it is of utter importance that a freelancer should envelop his/her monetary matters with intelligence so that taxes are paid and all bills are met with ease. Freelancers have the benefit of networking like other professionals and can increase their circle of contacts at their own time and convenience. Besides preparing a portfolio, freelancers can add to their credibility with business cards that can be circulated among associates, family, friends and organizations. Taking a break from work can give the freelancer time to attend events, exhibitions and trade fairs to make and acquire contacts.

      One of the vital freelance tips. One of the major reasons why many freelancers despite will and the ideal skills for the job fail to earn something substantial is not getting paid by the client or delayed payments. To save yourself from this next time, always demand some percentage of the down payment and full payment after showing the mockup of the work to the client. Through this method, you can ensure that you are getting paid on time. For this, you can also build any agreement or contract that you can ask your client to fill and sign before starting his work. In this contract, you can write the percentage of the total payment which you would take as the down payment before starting any work.

      While we have established that freelancing could be a rather rewarding and fulfilling career option, can it be called a 'stable' career choice? Yes it can be, especially if a freelancer chooses to work with a reputable freelancing portal. Freelance portals are the perfect middlemen - they offer you a platform to find interesting projects, bid for them at a price that you think fair, and then arrive at terms and conditions of contract that both you and the employer are happy with.  Additionally, they ensure a steady stream of lucrative projects to choose from, so that you don't have to wait for clients to reach out to you, but have a ready platform where you can reach out to clients yourself. Simply put, these freelancing portals take wastage of time out of the picture, so that you have projects to work on round the year.

      In conclusion, as a freelance provider you will be well on your way to being a sought after freelancer if you use the freelance job boards as your springboard for growing your name and brand. My advice is to bid low and sell yourself short in the beginning just to get jobs, projects, and experience. Once you have built your name and rating then you can start increasing your bids and asking for the going rate. Work for reviews in the beginning and you will be on your way to working for money. As for buyers, as long as you do your homework and check provider reviews then use escrow for payments, you will increase buyer protection for yourself. Using freelance job boards you can find quality, professional, and affordable freelance providers who are competent and reliable. Best of luck to you. A website like
