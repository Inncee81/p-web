    <h2>
     What are we?
    </h2>
    <p>
     We're software producers of a different kind.  Rather than market
   software the usual way, we openly deny its existence, and challenge
   our customers to do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     Skeptical?  Just ask yourself these simple questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Have you ever seen a piece of software?  Not just seen its
    output, or seen the pretty pictures it makes on the screen, but
    seen the
      <i>
       software itself
      </i>
      ?
     </li>
     <li>
      Have you ever felt a piece of software?  Tasted, touched it?
    Heard it??
     </li>
     <li>
      When you see programmers writing software, what does it look like
    they're
      <i>
       really
      </i>
      doing?  Are the results of their work
    immediately apparent, as with carpenters, painters, and plumbers?
    Or do you get the impression they're just pressing buttons
    randomly because they hope a piece of cheese will appear in the
    wall dispenser the way it always used to back in the good old
    days?
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     We urge you to come to the obvious conclusion: there is no such
   thing as software.  It is a mirage, an illusion, and the con
   artists who have foisted it on an unsuspecting public are some of
   the most successful swindlers in history.
    </p>
    <p>
     By buying our products, you will receive nothing of value, but on
   the other hand we will not
     <i>
      claim
     </i>
     that you have received
   anything of value either.  In this we differ from all other
   software companies, who will insist, in the face of abundant
   evidence to the contrary, that they have sold you a useable and
   beneficial item.  We firmly believe that a marketing strategy based
   on brutal honesty will be more effective in the long run than one
   based on deception and mass hypnotism.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Who are we?
    </h2>
    <p>
     We suspect many more
     <a href="people.html">
      people
     </a>
     may be
   involved in this than we know of; for one thing,
     <i>
      somebody
     </i>
     must be responsible for all the mailing
   lists and
     <a href="stuff.html">
      stuff
     </a>
     available from this
   server, and it certainly isn't us.
