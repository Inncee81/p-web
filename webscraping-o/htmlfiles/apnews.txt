the clamor to speed up the U.S. vaccination drive against COVID-19 and get the country back to normal, the first three months of the rollout suggest faster is not necessarily better.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A surprising new analysis found that states such as South Carolina, Florida and Missouri that raced ahead of others to offer the vaccine to ever-larger groups of people have vaccinated smaller shares of their population than those that moved more slowly and methodically, such as Hawaii and Connecticut.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The explanation, as experts see it, is that the rapid expansion of eligibility caused a surge in demand too big for some states to handle and led to serious disarray. Vaccine supplies proved insufficient or unpredictable, websites crashed and phone lines became jammed, spreading confusion, frustration and resignation among many people.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“The infrastructure just wasn’t ready. It kind of backfired,” said Dr. Rebecca Wurtz, an infectious disease physician and health data specialist at the University of Minnesota’s School of Public Health.

Conspiracy theories, poor communication and undependable shipments slowed efforts after the first vials of precious vaccine arrived Dec. 14.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the size of the eligible population was always within the control of state officials, who made widely varying decisions about how many people they invited to get in line when there wasn’t enough vaccine to go around.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:10020442430\">Full Coverage: Coronavirus vaccine\u003c/div>\u003cp>When the drive began, most states put health care workers and nursing home residents at the front of the line. In doing so, states were abiding by national recommendations from experts who also suggested doing everything possible to reach everyone in those two groups before moving on to the next categories.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But faced with political pressure and a clamor from the public, governors rushed ahead. Both the outgoing Trump administration and the incoming Biden team urged opening vaccinations to older Americans.\u003c/p>\u003cp>By late January, more than half the states had opened up to older adults — some 75 and above, others 65 and up. That’s when the real problems started. \u003c/p>\u003cp>South Carolina expanded eligibility to people in Steven Kite’s age group Jan. 13. Kite, 71, immediately booked a vaccination at a hospital. But the next day, his appointment was canceled along with thousands of others because of a shortage of vaccine.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It was frustrating at first,” Kite said. After a week of uncertainty, he rescheduled. He and his wife are now vaccinated. “It ended up working out fine. I know they’ve had other problems. The delivery of the doses has been very unreliable.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Missouri, big-city shortages sent vaccine seekers driving hundreds of miles to rural towns. Dr. Elizabeth Bergamini, a pediatrician in suburban St. Louis, drove about 30 people to often out-of-the way vaccination events after the state opened eligibility to those 65 and older Jan. 18 and then expanded further.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We went from needing to vaccinate several hundred thousand people in the St. Louis area to an additional half-million people, but we still hadn’t vaccinated that first group, so it has been this mad dash,” Bergamini said. “It has just been a whole hot mess.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It got a little chaotic,” said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. “We created far more demand than there was supply. That stressed the system and that may have left the system less efficient.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Plescia said the analysis suggests that “a more methodical, measured, judicious, priority-based approach — despite people’s perception — actually can be as efficient, or more efficient, than opening things up and making it available to more people.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In retrospect, health workers and nursing home residents were the easy groups to vaccinate. Doses could be delivered to them where they lived and worked.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We knew where they were and we knew who they were,” Wurtz said. As soon as states went beyond those populations, it got harder to find the right people. Nursing home residents live in nursing homes. People 65 and older live everywhere.\u003c/p>\u003cp>West Virginia bucked the trend with both high numbers of eligible residents and high vaccination rates in early March, but the state started slow and built its capacity before expanding eligibility. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Similarly, Alaska maintained a high vaccination rate with a smaller eligible population, then threw shots open to everyone 16 and older March 9. This big increase in eligible adults near the end of the period studied led the AP and Surgo Ventures to omit Alaska from the analysis.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The analysis found that as of March 10, Hawaii had the lowest percentage of its adult population eligible for vaccination, at about 26%. Yet Hawaii had administered 42,614 doses per 100,000 adults, the eighth-highest rate in the country.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Thirty percent of Connecticut’s adult population was eligible as of the same date, and it had administered doses at the fourth-highest rate in the country.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In contrast, Missouri had the largest percentage of its adult population eligible at about 92%. Yet Missouri had dispensed 35,341 doses per 100,000 adults, ranking 41st among the states.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Seven states in the bottom 10 for overall vaccination performance — Georgia, Tennessee, Texas, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina and Missouri — had larger-than-average shares of their residents eligible for shots. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Among high-performing states, five in the top 10 for high vaccination rates — New Mexico, North Dakota, Connecticut, Wyoming and Hawaii — stuck with more restrictive eligibility. Another two high-performing states from the top 10 — South Dakota and Massachusetts — were about average in how many residents were eligible for vaccine.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This is a thorough analysis showing a clear association between breadth of eligibility and vaccination rates across states,” said Dr. Mark McClellan, a former head of the Food and Drug Administration who was not involved in the new analysis but reviewed it for AP.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The better-performing states could be getting results by paying closer attention to vaccine supply, thoroughly vaccinating high-risk groups and then opening to additional categories more slowly as they wait for supplies to build, McClellan said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>What happens next will depend on how much states can improve their vaccine delivery systems and whether Americans remain eager for vaccination, even as the threat eases with more people protected and case numbers dropping.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Have states used this time wisely and fruitfully to lay down the infrastructure needed to open it up to more people?\" Sgaier asked.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press Writer Heather Hollingsworth in Mission, Kansas, contributed to this report.\u003c/p>","truncatedFirstWords":true,"mediaCount":6,"shortId":"459febd1a33bf8909bfaa88ce3f43159","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/459febd1a33bf8909bfaa88ce3f43159","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{},"downloadSettings":null,"audioMedia":[],"contexts":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":[{"leadHubLink":true,"displayName":"Coronavirus vaccine","calloutText":"Full Coverage:","isPermanentlyPlaced":true,"tag":{"isPr":false,"name":"Coronavirus vaccine","canonicalName":"coronavirus-vaccine","id":"Coronavirusvaccine"},"type":"Hub Link","id":"afs:Content:10020442430"}],"xxUpdated":"2021-03-21 18:38:51","socialEmbeds":[{"isHeroImage":false,"id":"se0:b910b5c0-7c50-11eb-8762-215148152818","caption":"","html":"\u003ciframe title=\"Pace of vaccinations can slow with expanded eligibility\" aria-label=\"chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-vp4mH\" src=\"https://interactives.ap.org/embeds/vp4mH/3/\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border:none\" height=\"400\">\u003c/iframe>\u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\u003c/script>","display":"se0","alignment":"middle"}],"flattenedFirstWords":"Despite the clamor to speed up the U.S. vaccination drive against COVID-19 and get the country back to normal, the first three months of the rollout suggest faster is not necessarily...","id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:459febd1a33bf8909bfaa88ce3f43159","media":[{"altText":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","xxUpdated":"2021-03-21 18:33:35","audioMimeType":null,"id":"24efa00229f94a0d9972b8e6bf72cb0c","alignment":null,"embedCaption":null,"videoRenderedSizes":[],"imageMimeType":"image/jpeg","state":null,"etag":"24efa00229f94a0d9972b8e6bf72cb0c_1a1aza3c0","externalId":null,"videoMimeType":null,"managementId":null,"flattenedCaption":"FILE - In this March 9, 2021, file photo, Army health specialists fill syringes with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in Miami.

We are expelling single adults. And we’ve made a decision that we will not expel young, vulnerable children.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The White House has steadfastly refused to call the situation a “crisis,” leading to a Washington battle over the appropriate description of the tense situation. Career immigration officials had warned there could be a surge after the November election and the news that Trump's hard-line policies were being reversed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the first days of his term, Biden acted to undo some of Trump’s measures, a rollback interpreted by some as a signal to travel to the United States. While the new administration was working on immigration legislation to address long-term problems, it didn’t have an on-the-ground plan to manage a surge of migrants. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We have seen large numbers of migration in the past. We know how to address it. We have a plan. We are executing on our plan and we will succeed,” Mayorkas said. But, he added, “it takes time” and is “especially challenging and difficult now” because of the Trump administration's moves. “So we are rebuilding the system as we address the needs of vulnerable children who arrived at our borders.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Biden officials have done away with the “kids in cages” imagery that defined the Trump family separation policy — though Trump used facilities built during the Obama administration — but have struggled with creating the needed capacity to deal with the surge. Unaccompanied children and teenagers in Customs and Border Protection custody must be transferred to the care of Health and Human Services within three days, although the minors coming now are being held for days longer than that.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Officials are trying to build up capacity to care for some 14,000 migrants now in federal custody — and more likely on the way. Critics say the administration should have been better prepared.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I haven’t seen a plan,” said Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas. “They have created a humanitarian crisis down here at this border that you have seen now. And the reason why they are coming is because he says words do matter, and they do. The messaging is that if you want to come, you can stay.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The administration also has been pressed as to why it will not allow media to see the facilities at the border. Mayorkas said the government was “working on providing access so that individuals will be able to see what the conditions in a Border Patrol station are like.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>But Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., told “Fox News Sunday” that \"it’s rich that Secretary Mayorkas won’t let press travel with him to the border, but he will come on your Sunday morning show and peddle the same kind of nonsense that has created the Biden border crisis in the first place.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Since Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20, the U.S. has seen a dramatic spike in the number of people encountered by border officials. There were 18,945 family members and 9,297 unaccompanied children encountered in February — an increase of 168% and 63%, respectively, from the month before, according to the Pew Research Center. That creates an enormous logistical challenge because children, in particular, require higher standards of care and coordination across agencies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Among the reasons for the surge: thousands of Central American migrants already stuck at the border for months and the persistent scourge of gang violence afflicting Northern Triangle countries — Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, the encounters of both unaccompanied minors and families are lower than they were at various points during the Trump administration, including in spring 2019. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Pointing to the urgency of the situation at the border, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., expressed confidence that enough Republicans would vote to pass an immigration overhaul.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We go into this debate, whether it’s a crisis or a challenge at the border. Let me tell you, the crisis. We need to address our immigration laws in this country that are broken,” said Durbin. “What we see at the border is one exhibit of it, one exhibit of evidence in that.

Gun sales nationwide, meanwhile, surged to record levels last year amid pandemic-related uncertainty.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Against that backdrop, lawmakers in at least four states — Arizona, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont — have proposed creating or expanding waiting periods.\u003c/p>\u003cp>New gun laws will not fix \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/us-news-race-and-ethnicity-shootings-las-vegas-mass-shooting-georgia-58690b8fd13adc6e76ef2b306fd2c58f\">deep-seated problems\u003c/a> such as \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-race-and-ethnicity-shootings-asia-georgia-119ed77c0d857c13509ccc259887591b\">racism, misogyny and violence\u003c/a>, said Seo Yoon “Yoonie” Yang, a leader with Students Demand Action, a gun violence prevention group. But they can help keep guns out of the hands of people who would do harm in the meantime, she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Legislation is practical. Research shows that it works,\" she said. \"It is change that can happen efficiently and quickly.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Colorado, Democratic state Rep. Tom Sullivan ran for office after his son, Alex, died along with 11 others when a gunman opened fire in an Aurora movie theater eight years ago. Sullivan said he hopes a waiting period in legislation he's planning to sponsor could help curb domestic violence and suicide.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In Atlanta, imagine if this guy’s parents or somebody else were notified that he was trying to get a firearm. Maybe they could have helped,\" he said. “It wouldn’t have hurt anybody to wait ... let it breathe a while. If there’s a problem, let it surface, we’ll sort it out.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association, oppose waiting periods. The group points to 2018 \u003ca href=\"https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/firearms-trace-data-2018\"> federal firearm-tracing data\u003c/a> that shows the average time between first retail sale of a gun and involvement in a crime was nearly nine years. They also argue that waiting periods create a delay for people buying legally, while leaving illegal weapons transfers unaffected.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“A right delayed is a right denied,” Second Amendment Foundation founder Alan Gottlieb said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gun control legislation also is making its way through Congress. The Senate is expected to consider a bill to expand background checks, but it faces a difficult road — Democrats would need at least 10 Republican votes to pass it. While the House approved two bills to strengthen the checks this month, Congress has not passed any major gun control laws since the mid-1990s.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Georgia, the Republican-controlled Legislature may resist new firearms laws before it concludes business at the end of the month. But Wilkerson pointed to recent long-sought victories that once seemed improbable, including passage of a \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/race-and-ethnicity-shootings-georgia-ahmaud-arbery-coronavirus-pandemic-cd68207150500f76e248fdc899717cd5\">hate crimes law\u003c/a> and the likely repeal of a citizen’s arrest law a year after the death of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man pursued by armed white men while jogging. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\"You're going to run into resistance. It doesn't mean you don't try,\" Wilkerson said. “In tragedy, sometimes we can move forward. This may be the opportunity to look at another tragedy and do something about it.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"social-embed\" id=\"se1:bcb424d0-7c50-11eb-f18f-97cfdebe2af7\">\u003ciframe aria-label=\"Map\" height=\"504\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-16VjX\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://interactives.ap.org/embeds/16VjX/5/\" style=\"border:none\" title=\"Most states don’t require waiting periods for gun buyers\" width=\"100%\">\u003c/iframe>\u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\u003c/script>\u003cp class=\"social-caption\">\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Whitehurst reported from Salt Lake City.

He headed to Central Bible College, an Assemblies of God school in Springfield, Missouri. He preached at nearby churches and needed a piano player. Friends suggested Esther Shabaz, a fellow student from Gary, Indiana. They fell in love. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“When my dad proposed, he told her, ‘Esther, I can’t promise you wealth, but I can promise you lots of adventure,'” Milewski said. “She had a lot, a lot of adventure.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>After graduation and their wedding, Bill Ilnisky opened churches in the Midwest. In the late-1950s, the Ilniskys took congregants to Jamaica for a mission, fell in love with the island, and stayed on to run a church in Montego Bay for a decade. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It was during that time they adopted Milewski, then 2, from a Miami foster home. In 1969, the family moved from Jamaica to Lebanon, where Bill Ilnisky ministered to college students and taught. His wife started an outreach center and had a Christian rock band. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“At that time, Lebanon was an amazing country — gorgeous,” Milewski said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But in 1975, civil war broke out between Christian and Muslim factions, and Beirut, the nation's capital, became a battleground. Twice, bombs exploded outside their apartment — the first knocking Milewski out of bed, the second slamming her father to the ground.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“My mom thought he was dead,” Milewski said. “My mom and I went and hid in the bathroom all night, crying and praying.\" The next morning, bullet holes pocked the walls of apartments on every floor except theirs. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We attributed that to prayer,” she said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>They fled in 1976 when U.S. Marines evacuated Americans, catching the last plane out.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Shortly after their return to the States, Bill Ilnisky became pastor at Calvary Temple in West Palm Beach, later renamed Lighthouse Christian Center International. His wife started Esther Network International, aimed at teaching children to pray. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Tom Belt, a retired missionary in Oklahoma City, was a teenager at Calvary Temple when the couple arrived. He said Bill Ilnisky's tales of missionary work whetted his desire to travel. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Belt said the Ilniskys “were very accommodating, believed in others and very forgiving.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Bill Ilnisky retired three years ago and while physically healthy for a late octogenarian, had some dementia. His wife still ran her prayer network and did Zoom calls. \u003c/p>\u003cp>When the pandemic hit last year, the couple took precautions, Milewski said. Her mother stayed home and had groceries delivered, but Bill Ilnisky occasionally went out.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“He couldn't take it,” his daughter said. “He needed to be around people.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Sarah Milewski and her husband visited her parents on Valentine's Day, her mother's birthday. A few days later, her mom became ill, and not long after the couple were diagnosed with the virus and hospitalized. \u003c/p>\u003cp>While the prognosis was initially good, the disease overtook them. The decision was made Feb. 27 to put them in hospice. Jacqueline Lopez-Devine, chief clinical officer at Trustbridge hospice, said in her 15 years working with the dying, no couple had arrived together. She said there was no hesitation about putting them in the same room for their final days. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Because of the virus, Milewski said her goodbyes through a window, a microphone carrying “I love you” to her parents' bedside. They looked like they did when sleeping, her father lying on the right side, her mother facing him. He would nod as Milewski spoke; her mom tried to speak but couldn't. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It was horrible,” Milewski said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>At 10:15 a.m. on March 1, Esther Ilnisky died.

Krutwig was with Loyola for the last Final Four trip, and has since become one of only four players in Missouri Valley Conference history to record 1,500 points, 800 boards, and 300 assists.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And there’s a chance for more. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It’s a turn of events that Sister Jean could see happening. Before the game, she suggested Loyola, the MVC champs who won 25 games this year, might have gotten a raw deal with a No. 8 seeding that put it up against a 1 so early. \u003c/p>\u003cp>There was only one way to deal with that, and to anyone outside of of Champaign — or now holding a freshly obliterated bracket — it’s hard to argue this Loyola team isn’t the breath of fresh air this tournament-in-a-bubble sorely needed. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Sure, there have been upsets, some drama and little teams doing big things. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But there’s nobody quite like Sister Jean to put the whole thing in perspective. The Ramblers and March Madness — it’s a hard habit to break. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/College-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\u003c/p>","truncatedFirstWords":true,"mediaCount":4,"shortId":"e0442683206c360aad483f8daf4f6027","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/e0442683206c360aad483f8daf4f6027","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{"missourivalleyconferencemensbasketball":{"isPr":null,"name":"missouri valley conference men's basketball","canonicalName":null,"order":0},"westernathleticconferencemensbasketball":{"isPr":null,"name":"western athletic conference men's basketball","canonicalName":null,"order":0},"loyolaramblersmensbasketball":{"isPr":null,"name":"loyola ramblers men's basketball","canonicalName":null,"order":0},"bigtenconferencemensbasketball":{"isPr":null,"name":"big ten conference men's basketball","canonicalName":null,"order":0},"chicagostatecougarsmensbasketball":{"isPr":null,"name":"chicago state cougars men's basketball","canonicalName":null,"order":0},"illinoisfightingillinimensbasketball":{"isPr":null,"name":"illinois fighting illini men's basketball","canonicalName":null,"order":0}},"downloadSettings":null,"audioMedia":[],"contexts":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":[],"xxUpdated":"2021-03-21 18:38:51","socialEmbeds":[],"flattenedFirstWords":"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Loyola Chicago carried out 101-year-old superfan Sister Jean's plans to a T on Sunday, moving to the Sweet 16 with a 71-58 win over Illinois, the first No. 1 seed bounced from...","id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:e0442683206c360aad483f8daf4f6027","media":[{"altText":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","xxUpdated":"2021-03-21 18:44:09","audioMimeType":null,"id":"bbe9280cedb446f6b24052d0cfb12fc7","alignment":null,"embedCaption":null,"videoRenderedSizes":[],"imageMimeType":"image/jpeg","state":null,"etag":"bbe9280cedb446f6b24052d0cfb12fc7_0a1aza3c0","externalId":null,"videoMimeType":null,"managementId":null,"flattenedCaption":"Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt watches Loyola Chicago play Illinois during the first half of a men's college basketball game in the second round of the NCAA tournament at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Sunday, March 21, 2021.

No cheer squads. No packed buildings filled with neutral fans suddenly throwing their support behind a plucky double-digit underdog hoping to pull off an upset. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The games during the first week of the NCAA Tournament have still brought madness — see: Oral Roberts, North Texas, Ohio and Abilene Christian — but it’s a much different version than the past. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Yet despite the restrictions, despite the lack of fans with venue capacity capped at 22 % and despite teams being walled off from friends and family — the joy is still there. The fabric of March will always include upsets and big shots and they have come aplenty already. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>This March, things are just a little quieter. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We played most of the year with little or no fans. I think that atmosphere, that part of the experience for the student-athletes is noticeably missing,” Wisconsin coach Greg Gard said. “So when you add just a few into the crowd, that makes a difference. That adds life to the building.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>One of the hallmarks of NCAA Tournaments of the past is the atmosphere. The crowded arenas mixed between traveling diehards and neutral locals. The downtowns overflowing with visitors, the costumes and painted faces. \u003ca href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2016/03/28/villanovas-crying-piccolo-girl-year-later-smiling-now-headed-houston/82348490/\">Villanova's crying piccolo girl\u003c/a> and more.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There is still some of that in Indianapolis this year. But it’s on a far smaller scale and the line of delineation is obvious. Police vehicles and metal barricades surround parts of downtown around the hotel bubble where tournament teams are being housed. Skyways these use to walk to practices are closed off. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The meaning is clear. Family, friends and fans are on the outside looking in. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I haven’t seen my wife or my kids in over a week now, so I’ve obviously miss them terribly. I wave at my wife out of the hotel window every day since she got here,” Abilene Christian coach Joe Golding said after the 14th-seeded Wildcats stunned No. 3 seed Texas. “That’s the tough part about being here. I wish I could celebrate with them because she’s the rock of the family.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Fans are still here. The orange of Syracuse, Illinois and Oregon State still pop in a crowd. The Hogs were definitely being called at local establishments after Arkansas’ opening victory. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Supporters of Baylor, Gonzaga and Illinois have shown up expecting long stays. The Mean Green of North Texas, Golden Eagles of Oral Roberts and Golding’s Wildcats are sticking around longer than most anybody thought. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But it’s different. It was going to have to be different to function inside of a bubble and that’s translated to an atmosphere that’s not library quiet, but not a rocking madhouse either.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The NCAA has given little nods to each school participating, whether its the fight songs playing when the teams take the floor, or videoed performances of each school’s cheer squads being played at halftime. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The national anthem? It’s a recording. Coaches' instructions and criticisms often are clearly heard during games. And don’t expect crowd noise to rattle any free throws in the final seconds. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“You’re used to running out for the most part to packed houses. Obviously that’s different. I think we’re grateful the fact that there are fans here,” Illinois coach Brad Underwood said after its first-round win. “But it’s a little different feel. Once the ball is thrown up, the game is the game, and it is different that way. But I’m just ecstatic that we’re playing. Our players are ecstatic we’re playing. There’s going to be a champion.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>It’s not all stale atmospheres and library-quiet venues. Georgia Tech students roared inside Hinkle Fieldhouse until getting silenced by Loyola Chicago. Same with the hundreds of Grand Canyon students — known as Havocs — who were on hand for the first round matchup against Iowa. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Chants of “R-U” echoed through Bankers Life Fieldhouse as Rutgers won its first tournament game since 1983. Abilene Christian fans had Lucas Oil Stadium rocking well after midnight enjoying its upset of the flagship school in its home state. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For the guys at North Texas, who pulled one of the big first-round upsets by knocking out No. 4 seed Purdue, they loved the hostile feel of having most of Lucas Oil Stadium against them. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For the Mean Green, it definitely felt like March. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’re doing something we love to do, playing basketball. Yeah, I want to experience the crowd, the sellout,” North Texas star Javion Hamet said. “But it still was loud in there (Friday) night. It felt like 10- or 20,000 fans in there when Purdue went on a run. No, I don’t feel like we’re being shortchanged.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Added North Texas coach Grant McCasland, “We were playing a team from Indiana, the only team from Indiana in the tournament, in Indianapolis and I thought it was a pretty good atmosphere considering. Our guys loved it, man. It was a blast.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP Sports Writer Eric Olson contributed to this report.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>More AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/College-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\u003c/p>","truncatedFirstWords":false,"mediaCount":13,"shortId":"b52de6b2ce904a0c53dc9954668a694d","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/b52de6b2ce904a0c53dc9954668a694d","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{"southlandconferencemensbasketball":{"canonicalName":null,"name":"southland conference men's basketball","isPr":null,"order":0},"bigeastconferencemensbasketball":{"canonicalName":null,"name":"big east conference men's basketball","isPr":null,"order":0},"villanovawildcatsmensbasketball":{"canonicalName":null,"name":"villanova wildcats men's basketball","isPr":null,"order":0},"abilenechristianwildcatsmensbasketball":{"canonicalName":null,"name":"abilene christian wildcats men's basketball","isPr":null,"order":0}},"downloadSettings":null,"audioMedia":[],"contexts":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"xxUpdated":"2021-03-21 18:38:51","socialEmbeds":null,"flattenedFirstWords":"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — No bands.

The seeds of the current problems were sown last March, when Americans stayed home and dramatically changed their buying habits — instead of clothes, they bought electronics, fitness equipment and home improvement products. U.S. companies responded by flooding reopened Asian factories with orders, leading to a chain reaction of congestion and snags at ports and freight hubs across the country as the goods began arriving.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Main Street businesses are now forced to wait months instead of the usual weeks for a delivery from China, and no one knows when the situation will be resolved. Owners do a lot of explaining to customers, order more inventory than usual and lower their expectations for when their shipments will arrive.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Alejandro Bras used to be able to place an order to factories in China and expect to receive his products in 30 days. Now, with problems throughout the supply chain, “we’re adding an additional two months,” he says. And that two months is “iffy” — it can take even longer.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Bras’ company, Womple Studios, sells monthly subscription boxes with educational crafts and activities for children; many of the products are custom-made, so he can’t easily find substitutes. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Bras has found himself spending more time on logistics rather than product development, and more time apologizing to the Oakland, California, company’s customers who expect a shipment each month. Customers have been understanding — they realize the pandemic has upset shipping and trade worldwide.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The cluster of ships offshore are perhaps the most dramatic symptom of an overwhelmed supply chain. As production surged in Asia, more ships began arriving in the fall at ports in Los Angeles, Long Beach and other West Coast cities than the gateways could handle. Ships holding as many as 14,000 containers have sat offshore, some of them for over a week. At times there have been as many as 40 ships waiting; normally, there’s no more than a handful, according to the Marine Exchange of Southern California, a service that monitors port traffic and operations.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“With this type of backlog, it will take several weeks to work through that. It doesn’t go away. And new ships are sailing to the U.S. even as we speak,” says Shanton Wilcox, a manufacturing adviser with PA Consulting. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But there are choke points on land as well. It can take 8,000 trucks to haul the cargo away from a ship, says Kip Louttit, executive director of the Marine Exchange of Southern California. But when all those trucks hit the road, there aren’t enough available when dockworkers are trying to unload the next ships in port. Freight rail traffic has also been affected.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“When you have more cargo, you have a less efficient cargo moving system,” Louttit says. The pandemic itself is also slowing down the flow of goods, sidelining workers in warehouses at the ports, he says.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Put all the problems together, and when a ship gets into port, it takes five to seven days to unload instead of two to three, says Shruti Gupta, an industrial analyst with the consulting firm RSM. “That again has consequences on truckers and rail service, because they have to wait until the port clears,” she says.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Businesses also wait because of the high demand for space on ships, and inside the shipping containers that range from 20 to 45 feet long. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Normally a shipment can be booked with a couple days’ notice and currently you have to book containers 30 days in advance,” says Peter Mann, CEO of Oransi, a maker of air purifiers and filters based in Raleigh, North Carolina. He has to account for shipment times twice as long as normal in his operating plans.\u003c/p>\u003cp>When Mann began having trouble getting shipments in the fall, he decided to place larger orders — getting the goods manufactured wasn’t a problem and fewer deliveries meant less waiting time. It has meant investing more money in inventory.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Supply disruptions can be a more serious problem for smaller companies because, unlike larger players, they may not be able to shift production to other countries — for example, Western Hemisphere nations whose products can be shipped to East Coast ports. And big companies can better afford to use air freight, which is more expensive than shipping.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Because there’s so much competition for containers, the cost of importing is climbing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The price can be as much as five times as usual,” says Craig Wolfe, whose company, CelebriDucks, has had problems getting rubber ducks from China since the start of the pandemic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>One of Wolfe’s shipments sat on the dock for three weeks because there were no railcars available. Another that he expected to be shipped by mid-February still hasn’t left China. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It would have arrived by now,” says Wolfe, whose company is based in Kelseyville, California. He’s anxious because most of his products aren’t typical rubber ducks — they’re based on presidents and other celebrities and pop culture trends like the Harry Potter books and movies. Like Mann, he’s placed some larger-than-usual orders to be sure he has enough stock.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Exporters are also feeling the impact of the bottlenecks.

71-58 win over Illinois, the first No. 1 seed bounced from this year's NCAA Tournament. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Cameron Krutwig delivered a 19-point, 12-rebound masterpiece and the quick-handed, eighth-seeded Ramblers (26-4) led wire to wire. They befuddled a powerful Illinois offense to return to the second weekend three years after their last magical run to the Final Four. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The Ramblers will next play either Oklahoma State or Oregon State, who were set to meet later Sunday.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Their 2018 trip to the Final Four was headlined by Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt, the venerable team chaplain, who received both COVID-19 vaccination shots and clearance to travel to Indianapolis to see what inspiration she could provide in 2021. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Before taking in most of this game from the luxury suite — sitting in her wheelchair and decked out in her trademark maroon and gold scarf — Jean delivered a pregame prayer that could’ve been stripped straight from a John Wooden handbook. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“As we play the Fighting Illini, we ask for special help to overcome this team and get a great win,” she said. “We hope to score early and make our opponents nervous. We have a great opportunity to convert rebounds as this team makes about 50% of layups and 30% of its 3 points. Our defense can take care of that.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>From her mouth to their ears. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Illinois (24-7) earned top seeding for the first time since its own Final Four run in 2005, but fell behind by double digits in the first half and never got within striking range. The Illini committed 16 turnovers and scored 23 points fewer than their season average. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Illinois’ 7-foot second-team All-American Kofi Cockburn finished with 21 points on 7-for-12 shooting, but worked hard for every shot against the pestering presence of Krutwig and Co. \u003c/p>\u003cp>And Loyola’s handsy guards, Lucas Williamson and Keith Clemons, kept first-team All-American Ayo Dosunmu from ever finding his comfort zone. He finished with nine points, 11 under his season average.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The other All-American on the floor was a third-teamer, Krutwig, who looked all-world in this one. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Posting up, pivoting, dishing when necessary and causing all kinds of trouble on defense in the paint, the 6-9 senior played bigger. He also had five assists. Krutwig was with Loyola for the last Final Four trip, and has since become one of only four players in Missouri Valley Conference history to record 1,500 points, 800 boards, and 300 assists.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And there’s a chance for more. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It’s a turn of events that Sister Jean could see happening. Before the game, she suggested Loyola, the MVC champs who won 25 games this year, might have gotten a raw deal with a No. 8 seeding that put it up against a 1 so early. \u003c/p>\u003cp>There was only one way to deal with that, and to anyone outside of of Champaign — or now holding a freshly obliterated bracket — it’s hard to argue this Loyola team isn’t the breath of fresh air this tournament-in-a-bubble sorely needed. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Sure, there have been upsets, some drama and little teams doing big things. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But there’s nobody quite like Sister Jean to put the whole thing in perspective.

(AP) — No bands. No cheer squads. No packed buildings filled with neutral fans suddenly throwing their support behind a plucky double-digit underdog hoping to pull off an upset. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The games during the first week of the NCAA Tournament have still brought madness — see: Oral Roberts, North Texas, Ohio and Abilene Christian — but it’s a much different version than the past. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Yet despite the restrictions, despite the lack of fans with venue capacity capped at 22 % and despite teams being walled off from friends and family — the joy is still there. The fabric of March will always include upsets and big shots and they have come aplenty already. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>This March, things are just a little quieter. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We played most of the year with little or no fans. I think that atmosphere, that part of the experience for the student-athletes is noticeably missing,” Wisconsin coach Greg Gard said. “So when you add just a few into the crowd, that makes a difference. That adds life to the building.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>One of the hallmarks of NCAA Tournaments of the past is the atmosphere. The crowded arenas mixed between traveling diehards and neutral locals. The downtowns overflowing with visitors, the costumes and painted faces. \u003ca href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2016/03/28/villanovas-crying-piccolo-girl-year-later-smiling-now-headed-houston/82348490/\">Villanova's crying piccolo girl\u003c/a> and more.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There is still some of that in Indianapolis this year. But it’s on a far smaller scale and the line of delineation is obvious. Police vehicles and metal barricades surround parts of downtown around the hotel bubble where tournament teams are being housed. Skyways these use to walk to practices are closed off. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The meaning is clear. Family, friends and fans are on the outside looking in. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I haven’t seen my wife or my kids in over a week now, so I’ve obviously miss them terribly. I wave at my wife out of the hotel window every day since she got here,” Abilene Christian coach Joe Golding said after the 14th-seeded Wildcats stunned No. 3 seed Texas. “That’s the tough part about being here. I wish I could celebrate with them because she’s the rock of the family.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Fans are still here. The orange of Syracuse, Illinois and Oregon State still pop in a crowd. The Hogs were definitely being called at local establishments after Arkansas’ opening victory. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Supporters of Baylor, Gonzaga and Illinois have shown up expecting long stays. The Mean Green of North Texas, Golden Eagles of Oral Roberts and Golding’s Wildcats are sticking around longer than most anybody thought. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But it’s different. It was going to have to be different to function inside of a bubble and that’s translated to an atmosphere that’s not library quiet, but not a rocking madhouse either.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The NCAA has given little nods to each school participating, whether its the fight songs playing when the teams take the floor, or videoed performances of each school’s cheer squads being played at halftime. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The national anthem? It’s a recording. Coaches' instructions and criticisms often are clearly heard during games. And don’t expect crowd noise to rattle any free throws in the final seconds. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“You’re used to running out for the most part to packed houses. Obviously that’s different. I think we’re grateful the fact that there are fans here,” Illinois coach Brad Underwood said after its first-round win. “But it’s a little different feel. Once the ball is thrown up, the game is the game, and it is different that way. But I’m just ecstatic that we’re playing. Our players are ecstatic we’re playing. There’s going to be a champion.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>It’s not all stale atmospheres and library-quiet venues. Georgia Tech students roared inside Hinkle Fieldhouse until getting silenced by Loyola Chicago. Same with the hundreds of Grand Canyon students — known as Havocs — who were on hand for the first round matchup against Iowa. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Chants of “R-U” echoed through Bankers Life Fieldhouse as Rutgers won its first tournament game since 1983. Abilene Christian fans had Lucas Oil Stadium rocking well after midnight enjoying its upset of the flagship school in its home state. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For the guys at North Texas, who pulled one of the big first-round upsets by knocking out No. 4 seed Purdue, they loved the hostile feel of having most of Lucas Oil Stadium against them. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For the Mean Green, it definitely felt like March. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’re doing something we love to do, playing basketball. Yeah, I want to experience the crowd, the sellout,” North Texas star Javion Hamet said. “But it still was loud in there (Friday) night. It felt like 10- or 20,000 fans in there when Purdue went on a run.

Greece (AP) — On a pine-covered hill above the sparkling blue Aegean lies a boy’s grave, a teddy bear leaning against the white marble tombstone. His first boat ride was his last — the sea claimed him before his sixth birthday. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The Afghan child with a tuft of spiky hair stares out of a photo on his gravestone, a hint of a smile on his lips. “He drowned in a shipwreck,” the inscription reads. “It wasn’t the sea, it wasn’t the wind, it is the policies and fear.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Those migration policies are now being called into question in the case of the boy’s 25-year-old father, who is grieving the loss of his only child. Already devastated, the father has found himself charged with child endangerment for taking his son on the perilous journey from Turkey to the nearby Greek island of Samos. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The charges are a stark departure from Greece’s previous treatment of migrant shipwreck survivors. This is believed to be the first time in the European Union that a surviving parent faces criminal prosecution for the death of their child in the pursuit of a better life in Europe.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The father’s hopes were dashed on a cold November night against the rocks of Samos, a picturesque island that also houses Greece’s most overcrowded refugee camp.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='29e8e09574ce4336b0a42c2144b4b794' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Without him I don’t know how to live,” the young man said, his soft voice breaking as a tear rolled down his cheek. “He is the only one I had in my life. All my hopes were him.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Now, he says, he often thinks of killing himself. He no longer mentions the child’s name. The father agreed speak to The Associated Press on condition he only be identified by his initials, N.A., and that his son wouldn't be named. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It is not entirely clear why Greek authorities took the extreme step of charging this man when so many others have been in his place. Activists suspect the move indicates a hardening of Greece’s already restrictive migration policies, or suggest it could be an attempt to divert attention from possible negligence by the coast guard. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi rejected the idea that the case heralded a change in policy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If there is the loss of human life, it must be investigated whether some people, through negligence or deliberately, acted outside the limits of the law,” Mitarachi said, adding that each incident is treated according to its circumstances. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"8389c2d3d3e0439a9244b99b18c2152f\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>He noted that the lives of asylum-seekers aren't in danger in Turkey, a country the EU has deemed safe.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The people who choose to get into boats which are unseaworthy, and are driven by people who have no experience of the sea, obviously put human lives at risk,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The father said he had no choice but to make the journey. His asylum application in Turkey had been rejected twice and he feared deportation to Afghanistan, a country he fled at the age of 9. He wanted his son to go to school, where, unlike him, the boy could learn to read and write, and eventually fulfil his dream of becoming a police officer. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I didn’t come here for fun. I was compelled. I didn’t have another way in my life,” he said. “I decided to go for the future of my son, for my future, so we can go somewhere to live, and my son can study.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>At the southeastern edge of the EU and with thousands of kilometers of coastline bordering Turkey, Greece has found itself on the frontline of Europe’s migration crisis. From 2014 to 2020, more than 1.2 million people traveled along the eastern Mediterranean migration route, the vast majority through Greece, according to figures from the U.N. refugee agency. More than 2,000 died or went missing. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Last March, as Greek-Turkish relations soured, Turkey announced its borders to the EU were open, sending thousands of migrants to the Greek border. Greece accused Turkey of weaponizing the desperation of migrants and temporarily suspended asylum applications.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"066a5361a0f44a5bab12f9da13683257\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Aid groups and asylum seekers have also complained of pushbacks, the illegal deportation of migrants without allowing them to apply for asylum. They accuse Greece’s coast guard of picking up new arrivals and towing them in life rafts towards Turkish waters — a claim vehemently denied by Greek authorities. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The AP has pieced together what happened in the case of this mild-mannered father and his dead son from interviews with the father, another passenger, the man who first reported their arrival, the coast guard and legal documents.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Divorced and raising his son alone, N.A. said he obtained a smuggler’s number from a neighbor after his second asylum rejection in Turkey, where he had lived for years. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Their journey to Europe began in the Turkish coastal town of Izmir, where the 24 passengers, all Afghans, gathered in a house. Among them were Ebrahim Haidari, a 29-year-old construction worker, and his wife. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Haidari remembers the little boy as an intelligent, sweet child who easily struck up conversations with the other passengers and joked with the smugglers in fluent Turkish. He was struck by the close relationship between the boy and his young father, who Haidari said was as much a big brother and friend to the child as a father. \u003c/p>\u003cp>On Nov. 7, a cold, cloudy, windy night, the group boarded a truck headed to a wooded part of the Turkish coast, arriving at around 10 p.m.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There were four smugglers in all, Haidari said. The sea wasn’t particularly calm and the passengers were worried, especially since at least some couldn’t swim. But the smugglers assured them the weather would improve. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The boy didn’t share the adults’ anxieties. He had never been to the sea before, his father said, and he was eager to sail in a boat. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The boat was an inflatable dinghy, the type preferred by smugglers on the Turkish coast. Cheap and dispensable, they are usually overloaded with people, and a passenger is made to steer so the smugglers avoid arrest. At least one of the smugglers was armed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Once they donned lifejackets, everyone was forced into the boat, Haidari and the father said. One smuggler drove a short way before making a passenger take over the steering, telling him to head toward a light in the distance. In a flash, the smuggler dove overboard and swam away. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Sitting just in front of Haidari and his wife, the father held his son tightly in his arms. \u003c/p>\u003cp>As one hour turned into two and then three, the weather deteriorated. The wind whipped the sea into ever-larger waves, and the inexperienced designated captain struggled to control the boat.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I don’t know what the smugglers thought, leaving us in such a bad situation,” Haidari said. “We didn’t know anything about the sea.” \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"40635f2e93164371ba5258286dd02eab\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Tossed by the waves, the dinghy took on water. People screamed they would die. To make matters worse, fuel was running out — the smugglers had provided barely enough to reach Greece.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Suddenly, the shape of a mountain loomed out of the darkness. Terrified of dying at sea, they turned toward it.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the coastline was jagged with rocks. The waves smacked the dinghy against the rocks once, then twice. The boat broke in two. Before they knew it, the passengers were in the water.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As they tumbled into the inky sea, the child slipped out of his father’s embrace. The waves closed over the man’s head.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He didn’t know how to swim, but eventually his lifejacket brought him to the surface. He scanned the waves for his boy, listening for his voice. He shouted until the salt water made him hoarse. Nothing. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He sank beneath the waves again. Out of seemingly nowhere, a hand grabbed his and dragged him toward a rock. He doesn’t know who it was, but he is sure that person saved his life. \u003c/p>\u003cp>There was chaos all around. People were calling for their brothers, wives, sons. Haidari and his wife struggled in the waves to stay alive, crying and vomiting seawater. \u003c/p>\u003cp>At one point, N.A. and Haidari said, a boat appeared and switched on a searchlight. The survivors raised their hands and shouted for help, but the boat passed on.\u003c/p>\u003cp>About 15 to 20 minutes later, Haidari said, a second boat appeared. Again, they hoped for a rescue, but again the vessel shone its searchlights and moved on.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Maybe they didn’t see us or didn’t want to help us,” Haidari said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The father is certain the crew saw him and the people in the water. He said that when he shouted and waved, the patrol boat trained its searchlight on him. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“They didn’t help,” he said. “They were going around and coming back, going around and coming back.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>The account of the coast guard is quite different in the crucial question of whether it acted fast enough, and whether its patrol boats saw the struggling migrants. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Legal documents obtained by the AP show the process of charging the father was initiated by the Samos coast guard, which informed the prosecutor of a man’s arrest for “exposing his minor son to danger during the attempted illegal entry into the country by sea.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Greece’s Shipping and Island Policy Ministry, under whose jurisdiction the coast guard falls, didn't grant permission for Samos coast guard officials to speak to the AP. The prosecutor didn't respond to an interview request.\u003c/p>\u003cp>However, a Samos coast guard official outlined authorities’ account of events that night, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The coast guard was alerted at around midnight by an English-speaking man who provided coordinates for a possible migrant boat, the official said. The coordinates were on land on Cape Prasso, a mountainous, roughly five-kilometer-long (three-mile-long) peninsula of tough terrain, with steep rocky slopes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That man was Tommy Olsen, founder of Aegean Boat Report, a Norwegian nonprofit which monitors and provides information on arrivals on the Greek islands. Olsen said people who are reluctant to contact Greek authorities for fear of pushbacks contact him instead.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"5a3d59096f5d4391b7d41a5ac612dbac\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>On that night, Olsen said, he received a call from someone saying a group had arrived on Samos, but several people were missing. Olsen said he immediately informed the Samos coast guard and shared the coordinates.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The coast guard official said upon receiving the call, they immediately initiated emergency procedures, dispatching two coast guard vessels that left the main port of Vathy at around 12:20 a.m. The vessels arrived in the area at around 1 a.m., the official said, but saw nobody.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At around 6 a.m., one of the vessels spotted a heavily pregnant woman behind a rock in a treacherous part of the coast, the official added. While rescuing her, which took about an hour and a half, they found the boy’s body nearby. Documents show the vessel carrying the woman and child returned to Vathy at around 9:30 a.m. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The woman and child weren't related. At around the same time as they were found, at roughly 6:40 a.m. on Nov. 8, a two-person coast guard foot patrol came across a group of 10 people on the hill of Cape Prasso, several hours’ walk away. The group included the father. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“If you have a dead child, you try to figure out who he was with,” the official said. “It’s different when you have relatives there helping, and different when you find them alone.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>The suggestion is, the fact the father wasn’t with his son when they were found was a key reason for him being charged. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The indictment accuses him of “leaving your ... child helpless.” It says the father allowed his son to board an unseaworthy boat in bad weather without wearing an appropriate lifejacket — although a photo in the case file of the boy’s body clearly shows him in a child’s lifejacket. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"ccb02640950c4e0996236d9ad2e5351d\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“These people have to rely on smugglers, and these smugglers decide when and where people take these journeys,” said Nick van der Steenhoven, the Greece and Europe advocacy and policy officer for refugee rights charity Choose Love. The father and son, he said, “became victim of the failure of the European Union to provide safe and legal routes\" for asylum-seekers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The father, his defense lawyer, Dimitris Choulis, and Olsen paint another picture of that night’s events: one of delays and negligence by the coast guard. Choulis is filing an application with the Samos prosecutor requesting an investigation. The father, he said, is convinced his son would still be alive if the coast guard had acted faster.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The lawyer considers the charges “the product of panic and not the product of some broader policy ... But automatically we are creating one more obstacle to these people to claim asylum.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>N.A. said he desperately sought help to find his son all night.\u003c/p>\u003cp>When he managed to drag himself ashore, he said, he searched and shouted for his son to no avail. Nobody had seen his boy. He wanted to dive back into the waves to look for him, but didn’t know how to swim. \u003c/p>\u003cp>After searching for two hours, he decided to try to find help. He persuaded a group of survivors to go with him, and they trekked through the night across the tough terrain. \u003c/p>\u003cp>As dawn broke, they came upon the coast guard foot patrol. Court documents indicate the father managed to convey to the officers that his son was missing, showing them his possible location on a mobile phone. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The father said they soon realized the location was too far for a search on foot themselves, and that reinforcements were needed. The passengers were taken to the island’s refugee camp for identification and coronavirus testing.\u003c/p>\u003cp>His recollection of the exact timeline of events from there on is somewhat vague. A woman came to the father with a photo and asked if it was his son. It was. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He was told the boy had been found but had been taken to the hospital and was in a coma. The missing pregnant woman had also been found alive, he heard. \u003c/p>\u003cp>At some point the pregnant woman also arrived at the camp, and the father’s hopes were buoyed; if she had survived, perhaps his son would too.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Then he was separated from the others and taken for questioning. He asked to see his son, but was told he had to be interviewed first. \u003c/p>\u003cp>When the interview was over, he still wasn’t allowed to see his child. Eventually, he said, the police called the hospital. They told him his son had been dead already when he arrived at the hospital.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Why did they do this to me?” the father said, distraught at the idea he had held out false hope of his son surviving. “They should not have done that. They should have told me the truth.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>The father was then jailed on charges of endangering his son’s life.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I was heartbroken,” he said. “A person who loses his loved ones, his son, and then he goes to prison in that condition, alone ... Is it humane to do this thing?” \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"6f6306c1116f4aea81cf869f586a019a\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>It took three days and pressure from his lawyer, Choulis, for him to be allowed to see his son’s body.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The coast guard escorted him to the hospital morgue, handcuffed. When they came back up 15 minutes later, the man wasn’t wearing handcuffs anymore and the coast guard officers were carrying him, Choulis said. He had collapsed. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The father was eventually released on the bail condition that he not leave the country. Refugee organizations put him up in a hotel. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The little boy’s body lay in the morgue for weeks. His death certificate shows he was buried on Nov. 30, in the small cemetery above the village of Iraion, where other victims of migrant shipwrecks lie.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The father has since been granted temporary asylum in Greece. But without his son, he said, he doesn’t much care where, or if, he lives.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“His son was his friend, he was everything to him,” Haidari said. “He was his hope to be alive.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Theodora Tongas contributed to this report.

Their schedules will become a work-office “hybrid”: They'll commute to work mainly for group meetings and projects best-suited for face-to-face interaction. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Ford's announcement sent one of the clearest signals to date that the pandemic has hastened a cultural shift in Americans' work lives by erasing any stigma around remote work and encouraging the adoption of technology that enables it. Broader evidence about the post-pandemic workplace suggests that what was long called tele-commuting will remain far more common than it was a year ago.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A \u003ca href=\"https://www.hiringlab.org/2021/03/16/remote-job-postings-double/\">report this week \u003c/a> from the employment website Indeed says postings for jobs that mention “remote work” have more than doubled since the pandemic began. Such job postings are still increasing even while vaccinations are accelerating and the pace of new confirmed COVID cases is declining. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“If job postings are a guide, employers are increasingly open to remote work, even as some employees return to the workplace,” said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The share of Indeed's job postings that mention “remote work” or “work from home\" reached 7% last month, up from just below 3% a year ago. But in some industries, the gains were far more dramatic, including those that haven't traditionally welcomed remote work. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"1d685cc0-7c50-11eb-a08f-2594c2ed85c9\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In legal services, for example, remote-work postings for jobs including paralegals and legal assistants jumped from under 5% in the second half of 2019 to 16% in the second half of 2020, according to Indeed data. In banking and finance, for such jobs as actuaries and loan underwriters, remote-work postings surged from 4% to nearly 16%. For mental health therapists, they rose from 1% to nearly 7%. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"media-placeholder\" id=\"afs:Medium:9982884509\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Such shifts could, in turn, trigger changes in where people live and affect the varying economic health of metro areas. Some highly skilled workers could migrate from high-cost coastal cities, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/14f3537216974d64b292138206620270\">where they had clustered in the decade\u003c/a> after the Great Recession, to more affordable cities or small towns. Downtown offices could shrink and exist mainly for collaborative work. The tax revenue of large cities could tumble as fewer workers patronize downtown bars, restaurants and coffee shops. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“The pandemic has broken the social and cultural norms for how we work,” said Timothy Golden, a professor of management at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. “Remote work has become much more accepted.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Ford is just the latest company to allow more work from home after the pandemic. Salesforce, Facebook, Google and other tech firms have said they’ll continue work-from-home policies indefinitely. Target Corp. \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-minneapolis-9266c6f8a7d18c5ec4beafb23439ecea\">will leave one of four downtown\u003c/a> Minneapolis office locations because it’s moving to a hybrid model for 3,500 workers. It will keep other downtown offices.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Flexible remote work is hardly an equal opportunity perk. It is disproportionately concentrated among more educated, well-paid workers. The jobs of lesser-paid employees generally require on-site work or face-to-face contact with the public.\u003c/p>\u003cp>More than one-third of Asian employees and a quarter of whites worked from home because of the pandemic in January, according to an analysis of government data \u003ca href=\"https://conference-board.org/blog/podcasts/COVID-19s-Biggest-Legacy-Remote-Work-and-Its-Implications-for-the-US-Post-Pandemic-Labor-Market\">by the Conference Board\u003c/a>, a business research group. Just 19% of Black workers and 14% of Hispanics were able to do so.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ford has found over the past year that employees and supervisors believe that more work can be done remotely, that they can still connect with each other and that they have the means to do their jobs, said Kiersten Robinson, chief people and employee experiences officer. So when its hybrid schedule begins in July or soon thereafter, Ford will give teams a choice of when to come to the office.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Robinson said a flexible schedule will also help Ford compete for talent. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I do think we’re seeing a real shift in expectations among candidates,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Among the employees pleased by the new policy is Kelly Keller, Ford’s chemistry and material compliance manager. Keller, who has been working a hybrid schedule since the pandemic erupted a year ago, wouldn't want to go back to commuting to work each day. Now she generally works three days from home and then commutes for the next three workdays, an hour each way, to a lab in Dearborn, Michigan.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Sometimes when she’s home, she gets to take her daughter to elementary school and start work a little late before finishing later in the day.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I definitely enjoy the flexibility,” Keller said. “I would be grateful for the opportunity to continue the hybrid arrangement, for sure.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Of the workers she supervises, seven commute to the lab every day; four work from home. The at-home workers, Keller said, have been more productive than they were before the coronavirus struck because they often work during the time they would have been commuting.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“For most,” she said, “I think they put in longer days.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>A study last month by Alexander Bick, an economist at Arizona State University, and two colleagues \u003ca href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/10CHiAI56oMa7uXNYOLCp0l-IPE6YhZEv/view\">found that\u003c/a> nearly 13% of workers they surveyed plan to work from home full time after the pandemic — nearly double the 7.6% who did so in February 2020. An additional 25% expect to do so at least one day a week, up from 17% before the pandemic. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Company executives overwhelmingly report that remote work has succeeded during the pandemic, according to research by consulting firm PwC. About 55% said they envision allowing continued remote work, according to the survey of 133 executives of mostly large companies. Just 17% said they wanted employees back in the office as soon as possible. An additional 26% said they preferred only limited remote work but recognized that it's become popular with employees.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ford and other companies have been redesigning their offices, or considering doing so, to reflect fewer cubicles and personal offices and more conference rooms and other spaces for workers, who may be on-site for just part of the week, to collaborate.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A more flexible attitude about workplaces could \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-pandemics-oakland-san-francisco-detroit-2f81412b76082dc1649373bed99e7615\">deal a blow to the largest U.S. cities\u003c/a>. Many Americans are already capitalizing on remote work to leave New York, Los Angeles, Boston and the San Francisco Bay Area in favor of Phoenix; Tampa, Florida; Austin, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; and other less expensive areas, real estate data shows.\u003c/p>\u003cp>One telling detail: Even as the number of homes for sale has tumbled nationally in the past year, the supply of for-sale houses in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles has actually increased, according to the real estate brokerage Redfin. And the drop in available homes has been much smaller than the national average in other large coastal cities, such as Seattle, Boston and Washington.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Many cities may also absorb a financial hit even if remote workers don't move. One academic study estimates that spending by workers at downtown businesses will shrink 5% to 10% after the pandemic.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, said the pandemic has accelerated a trend that predated the virus: More Americans have sought cheaper homes in lesser-known cities and suburbs.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Fairweather herself left Seattle last summer after wildfires in Oregon turned the city’s skies smoky and dark. Originally, she, her husband and two small children planned to stay for just a month in a small town in Wisconsin, near his family. Soon, though, they decided to make it permanent, and Fairweather has been able to work remotely.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We liked the pace of life — we liked being near family,” she said. “It’s so affordable here.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Rugaber reported from Washington.

Days later, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/e27cfce9464809aa8c91afd74c930bb5\">amid massive protests over Floyd's death\u003c/a>, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz directed Attorney General Keith Ellison to take the case.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ellison, Minnesota’s first African American elected attorney general, is in court but Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank is leading the prosecution. Frank heads the state's criminal division.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The prosecution is bolstered by outside attorneys working for free. They include former U.S. acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal; former federal prosecutor Steven Schleicher; and Jerry Blackwell, who last year \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/d2f6c6d9dbf1dc55394d8160ddcfcbaf\">won a posthumous pardon\u003c/a> for a man wrongly convicted of rape in connection with the Duluth lynchings of 1920, and is a founder of the Minnesota Association of Black Lawyers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In addition to Katyal, the prosecution has received court approval for at least six other out-of-state attorneys to serve as co-counsels, according to court records.\u003c/p>\u003cp>DOES THE PROSECUTION HAVE DEEPER POCKETS?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Almost certainly. This is one of the most significant court cases in recent history and it is clear the state will spare no expense. That point was driven home by Ellison as soon as he took over, when he vowed to “bring to bear all the resources necessary to achieve justice in this case.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Conversely, the defense is funded through the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association's legal defense fund. The MPPOA is a police advocacy organization made up of local police unions from across the state. Though he was fired soon after Floyd's death, Chauvin earned the right to representation through his years as a member of his local union, the Minneapolis Police Federation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>MPPOA Executive Director Brian Peters said supporters of Chauvin have asked to donate to his defense, but no donations are accepted. Instead, those people are directed to the National Center for Police Defense. Donations to the center aren't used for legal purposes, Peters said, but rather for living expenses for Chauvin and the three other officers accused in Floyd's death, all of whom lost their jobs. Peters said he did not know how much has been donated on behalf of the officers.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"related-story-embed\" id=\"6e313080-7c50-11eb-de74-81dab295101e\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>HOW WAS NELSON SELECTED AS CHAUVIN’S ATTORNEY?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Peters said the MPPOA works with a group of 12 defense attorneys who take turns handling cases as they come up. Originally, Chauvin’s defense was assigned to attorney Tom Kelly, but Kelly retired and Nelson replaced him.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT IS NELSON'S BACKGROUND?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nelson is an attorney with the Minneapolis firm Halberg Criminal Defense.

Pyongyang has repeatedly claimed it won’t engage in meaningful talks while Washington persists with sanctions and pressure. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:9999192179\">Full Coverage: North Korea\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“It’s clear the North is trying to strengthen its bargaining power,” Shin said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But North Korea could also be gearing up for harsher words for the Biden administration over Blinken's repeated condemnation in Seoul of the North’s human rights record, something Trump largely ignored while pursuing media-friendly summits with Kim. That could complicate any future negotiations\u003c/p>\u003cp>The North is extremely sensitive to outside criticism over its abysmal human rights conditions, which it sees as an attack on its leadership, and Choe’s statement appeared to be crafted before the North could decide on a response to Blinken’s remarks. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“There’s probably going to be serious opposition from the North” over Blinken's human rights comments, said Park Won Gon, a professor of North Korea studies at Seoul’s Ewha Womans University. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>TALKS AND PRESSURE \u003c/p>\u003cp>Most experts agree that the North will eventually attempt to return to negotiations to try to win aid, but they differ over when — and what it would take for talks to resume. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Kim has recently been defiant about advancing a nuclear arsenal he sees as his strongest guarantee of survival. He has also urged his people to be resilient in the struggle for economic self-reliance while launching a new multiyear plan to salvage his broken economy. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Kim’s focus on his domestic economic drive could mean that the North stays away from talks for another year and comes back only after it becomes clear that Kim’s new policies are failing, Shin said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If North Korea is really desperate for a quick resumption of talks, they would test-fire an intercontinental ballistic missile around April 15,” the birthday of Kim’s state-founding grandfather Kim Il Sung, to pressure Washington into talks, Shin said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But he said it’s more likely that the North will avoid provoking the Biden administration — and inviting more pressure — because Kim’s priority is to quietly cement his country as a nuclear power, which is also a key purpose of his domestic economic drive. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The North might still try to conduct short-range test launches that threaten South Korea but not the American homeland. But, Shin said, “they will keep any dramatic action on hold at least until the Biden administration’s North Korea policy review is out.\" \u003c/p>\u003cp>Kim must navigate the tricky relationship with Washington while his nation faces sanctions, pandemic border closures and crop-killing natural disasters that may be pushing the North toward worse economic instability.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Whatever moves the North makes, its recent messages signal that it won’t return to talks unless the United States offers at least some level of sanctions relief.

President Joe Biden said the Senate should operate like it did in the “old days,” with senators forced to stand up and speak all day and night if they plan to object to his legislative agenda with a filibuster. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Changing the filibuster rules is an idea backed by some Senate Democrats eager to advance Biden's agenda in the evenly split 50-50 Senate. But Republicans are warning Democrats off any changes. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Here's a look at how the filibuster works in the Senate. \u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT'S A FILIBUSTER?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The filibuster is among the Senate’s “most distinctive procedural features,” according to the Congressional Research Service.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The Senate has a longstanding practice of allowing any one senator to object to the proceedings, what's generally referred to as a filibuster that can halt action or votes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Senators have famously stood at their desks for hours making their case, as the character played by Jimmy Stewart did in “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington” or as South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond did to stall the 1957 Civil Rights Act. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Today, senators can merely signal their intent to object, even privately, and that's enough for Senate leaders to take action. Leaders sometimes just drop the issue from floor consideration. At other times, they push ahead, taking cumbersome steps to cut off the filibuster and move forward with the proceedings.\u003c/p>\u003cp>HOW TO END A FILIBUSTER?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Over time, senators grew tired of the endless filibusters and set rules for ending debate.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At the start of the 20th century, a two-thirds vote was needed to end a filibuster. By 1975, the Senate agreed to lower it to 60 votes. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Once debate is brought to a close, senators can move forward with consideration of the measure at hand, amendments or even final votes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?\u003c/p>\u003cp>As the country, and Congress, has grown more partisan, the filibuster has become a key weapon in what is often described as a procedural arms race in the Senate.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Year by year, more and more senators threaten to wage filibusters to block legislation. Overcoming filibusters can take days, if not weeks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Even without a senator holding the floor, filibusters have forced senators into all-night and weekend votes to advance legislation, as happened during passage of the Affordable Care Act.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Filibusters and the prospect of filibusters shape much of the way in which the Senate does its work,” the CRS report said.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>CAN THE SENATE CHANGE THE FILIBUSTER?\u003c/p>\u003cp>It takes 51 votes to change the Senate rules, a tall order at most times but especially in the now evenly split 50-50 Senate. Democrats hold a slim majority because Vice President Kamala Harris can be a tie-breaking vote.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But senators have changed the filibuster rules before.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Fed up with the Republicans stonewalling Barack Obama's executive and judicial branch nominees, Democrats led by then-Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada changed the rules to set a simple 51-vote threshold for confirming people in those positions. '\u003c/p>\u003cp>Republicans under Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky went a step further, eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, which allowed Donald Trump's three high-court justices to be confirmed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>While several Democrats and advocacy groups call for ridding the Senate of the filibuster on legislation, there does not appear to be enough support from Democratic senators at this time to do so. \u003c/p>\u003cp>BACK TO ‘TALKING’ FILIBUSTER?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Biden supports a return to the “old days,\" as he put it, of the talking filibuster, forcing senators to stand at their desks and articulate their opposition to the proceedings, as was the practice when he first joined the Senate decades ago.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“You’ve got to work for the filibuster,” he said in an ABC News interview that aired Wednesday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The idea has support from Democrats who see it as a possible alternative to fully ending the filibuster practice. But it still poses risks, and Democratic leaders have been reluctant to move toward that option.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Several Republican senators, particularly those considering running for president in 2024, might see political advantage to seizing the floor to rail endlessly against White House priorities. The filibusters could also stall action on other Democratic priorities, including Biden's nominees. \u003c/p>\u003cp>McConnell has warned of a “scorched earth” reaction if Democrats eliminate the filibuster. \u003c/p>\u003cp>At the same time, many Democrats are ready to take that chance to end the filibuster, realizing their slim majority is fragile, and Republicans might do away with it anyway to advance their priorities the next time they control the Senate and the White House.\u003c/p>","description":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"truncatedFirstWords":true,"embedCaption":null,"sequenceNumber":null,"title":"US--Congress-Explaining The Filibuster","headline":"EXPLAINER: What's the Senate filibuster and why change it?","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"old_lead_video_key":null,"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:f476940e279b6bc2a1bbfd7c5cc24f96","signals":["newscontent"],"etag":"f476940e279b6bc2a1bbfd7c5cc24f96_0a9aza0c0","notificationId":null,"version":null,"videoContext":"ibuster and move forward with the proceedings.\u003c/p>","latestEtag":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"bylines":"BY LISA MASCARO","revision":null,"mediumIds":["ce1e2c5b0bed40908a2958999c5fedea","ff7c3cde712941bba283a6b324bc8e6b"],"media":[{"altText":null,"embedCaption":null,"imageFileExtension":".jpeg","title":null,"videoMimeType":null,"gcsBaseUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/ce1e2c5b0bed40908a2958999c5fedea/","state":null,"flattenedCaption":"Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., talks to reporters after a floor speech criticizing the filibuster, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, March 16, 2021.

He's been a dues-paying member pretty much ever since.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s been a part of my whole adult life,” Pelletier said. “It’s been a second home at times.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>But like VFW posts nationwide, the New Bedford hall struggled to draw new members. In the '60s, it had more than 1,000 paying members; by last year, it had roughly 100, the majority in their 70s and 80s.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The stigma of just being a bar is hard to overcome,” said Delfino Garcia, the post’s last commander. “Younger vets want something different. You’ve got to be more family-oriented. You’ve got to make it more hospitable. VFWs are struggling to adapt to that new reality.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Guilbeault, who joined the post in 1956 after serving in the Air Force, has no regrets about winding things down.\u003c/p>\u003cp>With mortgage payments and other bills mounting, he had put in more than $5,000 of his own savings in those final days. He eventually recouped the money when the building's sale was finalized in September, and the remaining profits went to the state VFW.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In a way, it’s been a blessing to let it go,” Guilbeault said. “If we’d kept going, we’d still be closed. There was no sense keeping it open.

Conspiracy theories, poor communication and undependable shipments slowed efforts after the first vials of precious vaccine arrived Dec. 14.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But the size of the eligible population was always within the control of state officials, who made widely varying decisions about how many people they invited to get in line when there wasn’t enough vaccine to go around.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"hub-link-embed\" id=\"afs:Content:10020442430\">Full Coverage: Coronavirus vaccine\u003c/div>\u003cp>When the drive began, most states put health care workers and nursing home residents at the front of the line. In doing so, states were abiding by national recommendations from experts who also suggested doing everything possible to reach everyone in those two groups before moving on to the next categories.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>But faced with political pressure and a clamor from the public, governors rushed ahead. Both the outgoing Trump administration and the incoming Biden team urged opening vaccinations to older Americans.\u003c/p>\u003cp>By late January, more than half the states had opened up to older adults — some 75 and above, others 65 and up. That’s when the real problems started. \u003c/p>\u003cp>South Carolina expanded eligibility to people in Steven Kite’s age group Jan. 13. Kite, 71, immediately booked a vaccination at a hospital. But the next day, his appointment was canceled along with thousands of others because of a shortage of vaccine.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It was frustrating at first,” Kite said. After a week of uncertainty, he rescheduled. He and his wife are now vaccinated. “It ended up working out fine. I know they’ve had other problems. The delivery of the doses has been very unreliable.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In Missouri, big-city shortages sent vaccine seekers driving hundreds of miles to rural towns. Dr. Elizabeth Bergamini, a pediatrician in suburban St. Louis, drove about 30 people to often out-of-the way vaccination events after the state opened eligibility to those 65 and older Jan. 18 and then expanded further.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We went from needing to vaccinate several hundred thousand people in the St. Louis area to an additional half-million people, but we still hadn’t vaccinated that first group, so it has been this mad dash,” Bergamini said. “It has just been a whole hot mess.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It got a little chaotic,” said Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. “We created far more demand than there was supply. That stressed the system and that may have left the system less efficient.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Plescia said the analysis suggests that “a more methodical, measured, judicious, priority-based approach — despite people’s perception — actually can be as efficient, or more efficient, than opening things up and making it available to more people.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In retrospect, health workers and nursing home residents were the easy groups to vaccinate. Doses could be delivered to them where they lived and worked.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We knew where they were and we knew who they were,” Wurtz said. As soon as states went beyond those populations, it got harder to find the right people. Nursing home residents live in nursing homes. People 65 and older live everywhere.\u003c/p>\u003cp>West Virginia bucked the trend with both high numbers of eligible residents and high vaccination rates in early March, but the state started slow and built its capacity before expanding eligibility. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Similarly, Alaska maintained a high vaccination rate with a smaller eligible population, then threw shots open to everyone 16 and older March 9. This big increase in eligible adults near the end of the period studied led the AP and Surgo Ventures to omit Alaska from the analysis.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The analysis found that as of March 10, Hawaii had the lowest percentage of its adult population eligible for vaccination, at about 26%.

He trained and worked as a pulmonologist but was fired through an emergency decree. He advocated for the tens of thousands of other civil servants who were purged in the aftermath of the 2016 coup attempt.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Gergerlioglu was convicted in 2018 and sentenced to two years and six months in prison for “spreading terrorist propaganda” after he retweeted a 2016 news article about a call for peace by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK. An appeals court confirmed the conviction, saying he was “owning” and “legitimizing” the PKK by sharing the link, which included a photograph of armed fighters. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The PKK is considered a terrorist organization in Turkey, Europe and the United States. It has led an armed insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984 and the conflict has killed tens of thousands of people.

The United States and the European Union have criticized the moves. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The Turkish president's nationalist ally, Devlet Bahceli, had called on the assembly's speaker to remove Gergerlioglu from the building in a series of tweets Saturday, describing him as a separatist. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The Grand Turkish National Assembly is not the dorms of separatists or the place where fugitives can take refuge. The dagger in the great Turkish nation's heart cannot be allowed to nest or tolerated ...

Douglas explores destinations like Selma, Alabama, and Memphis, Tennessee -- with historical background, itineraries and maps to help the traveler trace the steps of the heroes of the civil rights movement -- and understand the agonies that befell them and the triumphs they achieved.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Exploring the civil rights trail is a way of linking our lived experience to a time when Black Americans became united, committed and stronger,” Douglas says in the book's preface.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Its release comes as the U.S. undergoes a reckoning on racial injustice in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd last May in Minneapolis. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In an interview with The Associated Press, Douglas said when the opportunity to travel the trail presented itself, she took it. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The U.S. Civil Rights Trail is a collection of churches, schools, museums and other landmarks in the South where activists challenged segregation in the 1950s and 1960s to advance social justice, according to its \u003ca href=\"https://civilrightstrail.com/\">website. \u003c/a> The trail, announced in 2018, encompasses more than 100 surviving landmarks where major events of the civil rights movement occurred across 15 states. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Douglas' book primarily details sites in the South — North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, Virginia and Washington, D.C. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The trail is vast,” Douglas said. “It goes as far east as Wilmington, Delaware to as far west as Kansas and south into Louisiana and Florida.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We are literally surrounded by greatness and don't even know it,” she continued. “So many of the places I visited in writing this book are part of the daily fabric of our lives, but we miss opportunities to engage with them from the viewpoint of greatness they represent.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>She said her book, released in January, is not only a “basic guidebook ... it's also a history book, a civics book, a road map for activism and engagement with the Democratic experience.\" \u003c/p>\u003cp>There are snippets of information on some of the people who made the movement in each city she touches. In Charleston, South Carolina, for example, Douglas mentions Denmark Vesey, who bought his freedom using Charleston lottery winnings and in 1816 helped found Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal, the church where nine Black parishioners were shot and killed by a white supremacist nearly 200 years later. And in Atlanta, she highlights the Rev. Martin Luther King and U.S. Rep. John Lewis.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Douglas said the trail helps people to understand what “righteous people” are fighting for.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“When essential workers invoked living wage issues as a result of the pandemic, it goes back to the same issues that Dr. King was focusing on back in the day,\" she said. \"We are very much implicated in the things now that were happening 50, 60 years ago,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Douglas said she hopes readers will embrace the guidebook by incorporating some of the itineraries created for each city and physically visit the historic sites listed - like the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma and Atlanta's Sweet Auburn Historic District. She hopes they'll also get to know the voices, the stories and the culture that shape and celebrate the Black American experience in each city. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The book includes restaurant suggestions and music playlists that include modern classics like Nina Simone's “Mississippi Goddam,” which bewails the racially motivated killings of Emmett Till -- a Black teenager lynched by a white mob in 1955 -- and civil rights activist Medgar Evers, slain in the driveway of his Jackson home.\u003c/p>\u003cp>An award-winning journalist, Douglas also has served as the Eugene S. Pulliam distinguished visiting professor of journalism at DePauw University. She was managing editor of MLK50: Justice Trough Journalism and is currently a senior leader of The OpEd Project, a global initiative to amplify underrepresented voices.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I tell you when to go, where to shop, where to hang out and, especially, where to eat,” she said, laughing, referring to her guidebook. “In the later chapters, I built timelines to tell you about the civil rights movement into 2020. It’s a book about the past, but it’s also all about now.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Kabria Baumgartner, an associate professor of American studies and English at the University of New Hampshire, said the book is very timely.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Amid the wave of Black Lives Matter protests, more people seem to be visiting historic areas and sites that chronicle the history of racial justice movements in the United States,” she said in an emailed statement. “Once the pandemic subsides, we’ll need to deal with our collective trauma in order to heal from it. In some ways, the U.S. Civil Rights Trail can help guide us, literally and figuratively, and push us along.

Since January, Gut-Behrami won six World Cup races — including four straight in super-G — plus two gold medals and a bronze at the worlds last month in Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Lara didn’t have enough energy to give it all and didn’t want to take the risk to get injured and that’s the reason why she stopped,” Swiss team spokesman Jérôme Krieg said in a statement. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>There was quick speculation that Gut-Behrami was making a protest against organizers after comments earlier in the week critical of the race week scheduling rules. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The downhill and super-G events — where Gut-Behrami is stronger than Vlhova — were canceled by difficult weather conditions on Wednesday and Thursday. They could not be moved to Friday when the little-regarded team parallel racing event went ahead without problems.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Krieg said fatigue was “the only reason (for stopping). She’s happy about her season, that it is over now and that she is healthy.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Gut-Behrami did not stop to speak with media in the finish area, and was due to return to the course for

released its annual financial results a year after the pandemic sent the price of oil crashing to all-time lows as people stopped moving around the world to stem the spread of the virus. In recent weeks, however, the price has edged up as movement restrictions ease, commerce increases and more people get vaccinated against COVID-19. Still, analysts caution that a peak in demand may still be far off.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Despite the 44% drop in net income, Aramco said it would stick to its promise of paying quarterly dividends of $18.75 billion — $75 billion a year — due to commitments the company made to shareholders in the run-up to its initial public offering. Nearly all of the dividend money goes to the Saudi government, which owns more than 98% of the company. Aramco's policy to pay dividends significantly higher than its 2020 free cash flow of $49 billion stands in sharp contrast to other oil giants that have cut payouts. Seeking a cash infusion to pay the billions of dollars in the face of dwindling revenue, Aramco recently has \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/dubai-saudi-arabia-united-arab-emirates-dividends-coronavirus-pandemic-ea2d30526c11b77de2e8c633ab049285\">issued international bonds\u003c/a>. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The public figures, obligatory ever since the mostly state-owned company listed a sliver of its worth on Riyadh’s Tadawul stock exchange in 2019, offer valuable insight into the health of the region’s largest economy. Despite Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s efforts to diversify the economy away from oil, the kingdom remains heavily dependent on oil exports to fuel government spending.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Saudi Aramco profit of $49 billion in 2020 is down from \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/9d7bd0964b35594497ca38b398f184f0\">$88.2 billion in 2019\u003c/a> and $111.1 billion in 2018. Still, Aramco remains one of the world’s most valuable companies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In one of the most challenging years in recent history, Aramco demonstrated its unique value proposition through its considerable financial and operational agility,” President and CEO Amin H. Nasser said in a statement. “As a result, our financial position remained robust.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The company produced the equivalent of 9.2 million barrels per day of crude oil over the course of the year, its annual results said. Capital expenditure was down in 2020 to $27 billion compared to $32.8 billion the year before. Aramco expects to spend $35 billion this year, some $5-10 billion lower than previous estimates.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Aramco facilities have come under increasing attack as Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels across the southern border target the kingdom's oil refineries and export terminals.

For the first time in a year, the price of Brent surpassed $60 a barrel last month and traded over $64 a barrel Sunday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The price increase has come as Saudi Arabia seems determined to curb output and support crude markets even as demand rises, with nations lifting lockdowns and accelerating vaccination campaigns.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Nasser struck an optimistic note about the year ahead, saying that Aramco is “seeing a pick-up in demand in Asia and also positive signs elsewhere.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We remain confident that we will emerge on the other side of this pandemic in a position of strength,” he added. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Earlier this month, the kingdom said it would extend its voluntary production cut of 1 million barrels a day through to April. Most OPEC oil cartel and allied countries likewise left their production cuts in place — in stark contrast to March of last year when a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia prompted the two oil giants to unleash an onslaught of crude on the market as demand dipped. Saudi officials have urged caution, arguing that global economic recovery may still be undermined by new coronavirus restrictions and fast-spreading virus variants.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Before December of 2019, when Aramco floated 1.5% of its shares on the stock exchange, the firm was owned directly by the Al Saud ruling family and didn’t need to announce results. Initially, Aramco listed at 32 riyals ($8.53) a share, becoming the world’s most valuable listed company, with a market valuation of $1.7 trillion. Since then, however, Aramco lost its stock exchange crown to Apple as its value declined. On Sunday it traded around 35 riyals ($9.30) a share.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As oil prices fell and the virus coursed across the world, the Saudi economy has shown signs of strain. It shrank more than 4% last year, according to the government statistics agency. Despite spending cuts and efforts to ramp up non-oil revenue — including by tripling the value-added tax to 15% — the government deficit widened. Last year, Saudi Arabia needed an oil price of more than $76 a barrel to balance its budget.\u003c/p>","truncatedFirstWords":false,"mediaCount":1,"shortId":"672f523f199c133b4b9c819eea5acf6b","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/672f523f199c133b4b9c819eea5acf6b","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{"saudiarabianoilco":{"isPr":null,"name":"saudi

Virginia didn't arrive in Indianapolis until Friday, making it the last team to get there, because it needed to clear quarantine protocols back home, and the unusual preparation couldn't have helped the fourth-seeded Cavaliers, who were upset by Ohio on Saturday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The first full day of action went off without a hitch Friday. Then Day 2 was well underway when a terse news release arrived: “The NCAA and the committee regret that VCU’s student-athletes and coaching staff will not be able to play in a tournament in which they earned the right to participate.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>The NCAA said it made the decision to drop VCU from the competition in consultation with the local health department.\u003c/p>\u003cp>This wasn't the first coronavirus issue of the season for the Rams: A positive test in January forced them to halt basketball activities and postpone a game against Davidson. But VCU resumed practice two days later and made it through the rest of the regular season without problems.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Rams lost the Atlantic 10 title game but made it into the tournament as an at-large team. They were 19-7 heading into Saturday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Now their postseason is over, without the chance to actually play in the Big Dance.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It's a reminder that we just have to stay safe,” Southern California coach Andy Enfield said after his team's win over Drake. “And sometimes, the COVID takes twists and turns. They’re unexpected. And so I’m very sorry to hear that.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Kansas coach Bill Self, whose team also won Saturday, called the situation \"high anxiety for everything.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It doesn’t matter if it’s 2 o’clock in the morning, (as) soon as we get a text message from the (testing) company we’ll get group texts going,\" Self said. \"I’m getting messages from the trainer at 2 o’clock, and I’m

Lannon has been charged only with the death in New Jersey, and his lawyer says his client was provoked. He has been named a person of interest in the four New Mexico slayings.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='8d6a8598868d4aeea291c30f68e58519' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Police Lt. David Chavez in Lannon’s hometown of Grants, New Mexico, said authorities have no indication that his claims about 11 other killings are true and that they aren’t aware of any missing-person or homicide reports that would fit his narrative.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Is it possible? Sure, anything’s possible. Is it plausible?” Chavez said. “Unfortunately we are still investigating that and conducting search warrants for evidentiary value.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>It was a twist in a case that spans the country but has many unanswered questions, including how Lannon was connected to the New Mexico slayings. Officials from the FBI, U.S. Marshals Service, several police agencies in New Mexico, and police and prosecutors in New Jersey either didn't respond to requests for comment Saturday or didn't immediately have more information.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The case began on March 5, when the bodies of Lannon’s ex-wife and three other people were found in a vehicle in a parking garage at Albuquerque International Sunport, New Mexico’s largest airport. It's not clear how they were killed. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Police say three of them were reported missing in January from Grants, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) west of Albuquerque. The victims were identified as Jennifer Lannon, 39; Matthew Miller, 21; Jesten Mata, 40; and Randal Apostalon, 60. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Chris Whitman, Jennifer Lannon's brother, said that Sean Lannon told the family in January that Jennifer had “run off” with some friends, possibly to Arizona. Whitman said that didn't sound right.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“She was a great mom and, just, it would be uncharacteristic of her to not be with her children,” Whitman told The Associated Press Saturday in a telephone interview from his home in Washington Township, New Jersey. When the family were unable to reach her, he said they filed a missing person's report.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Jennifer Lannon, Miller and Mata were friends, and Apostalon lived out of his car and was known to give rides for money, Grants police said. The bodies were found in Apostalon’s car.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I can understand he (Sean Lannon) stated that, you know, he shot his wife and her boyfriend,\" Chavez said. “But Matthew was not her boyfriend, so I don’t know how he became involved.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Whitman told the AP that Sean Lannon had flown to New Jersey March 4 with the couple's three young children — girls 6 and 7, and a boy aged 4. Lannon took them to his parents' house and said he was going back to New Mexico to continue looking for Jennifer.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Whitman told the AP that although the couple had divorced after nearly a decade of marriage, they were still living together. They were even talking of moving the family back to the East Coast, he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“They were still parenting together, and there was no indication that there was trouble —at all,\" said Whitman. \"From my knowledge and our family’s knowledge, they were working on their relationship and heading in the right direction.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>On March 8, three days after the remains were found in New Mexico, the body of Michael Dabkowski was discovered in his New Jersey home, just south of Philadelphia, after a welfare check. Sean Lannon is accused of breaking in and beating the 66-year-old to death with a hammer, according to an affidavit. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Lannon told investigators that Dabkowski had sexually abused him as a child and that he had gone to the home to retrieve sexually explicit photos. Dabkowski mentored Lannon and his twin brother through a Big Brothers program in the 1980s, NJ.com reported.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Whitman said the family did not know of the alleged abuse. In fact, he said he met Dabkowski at the birthday part of one of the Lannon children a couple of years ago, and all seemed fine.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I knew he was a close, just a close friend to Sean, and that he was a father figure,\" Whitman said. \"But outside of that, we knew nothing else.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>A search for Lannon ended with his arrest in St. Louis on March 10. He was driving a car stolen from Dabkowski.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In court in New Jersey on Friday, public defender Frank Unger challenged probable cause for the murder charge, arguing that Dabkowski had allowed Lannon into his home and that what followed amounted, at worst, to manslaughter provoked by passion, NJ.com reported. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He said Lannon didn’t want anyone “to have control over me any longer” in trying to take back the photos. Dabkowski had “documented those sexual assaults, those rapes, by taking pictures of himself with Mr. Lannon in sexually compromised positions,” Unger said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The public defender said Lannon retrieved two hammers from Dabkowski’s garage and gave them to the victim, saying, “You’re going to need these. I don’t want to hurt you.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I would suggest that this fact alone illustrates this was not purposeful murder. He did not even bring a weapon to the home,” Unger said, arguing that Dabkowski attacked his client and then was killed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Unger wanted the judge to release Lannon before trial, saying he had no prior convictions and is an Army veteran with an honorable discharge.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Lannon was born in Massachusetts and spent most of his early years in suburban Philadelphia's Gloucester County before he was deployed to Germany, Unger said. He has family in southern New Jersey, including his mother and sister.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But Gutierrez said Lannon “admitted his efforts to conceal evidence” in killings in New Mexico.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The prosecutor added that Lannon had previously spent a week in jail in New Mexico for failing to appear in court. It wasn’t clear what he had been cited with.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The judge ordered that Lannon remain behind bars.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Unger, an attorney for Sean Lannon's family and Big Brothers Big Sisters Independence Region didn't immediately respond Saturday to messages seeking comment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Whitman said Lannon's story of abuse was “heartbreaking.” And while his family is angry and hurt, there is a part of him that feels sorry for his former brother-in-law.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We still want justice,\" Whitman said. \"We’re clinging to our faith right now in the Lord. And, you know, one day — it might not be any time soon — we want to get to a place of forgiveness for him.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>This story has been updated to delete incorrect attribution in the first paragraph about the suspect's confession to 11 killings.

The defending NBA champions already are without All-NBA big man Anthony Davis, who has missed 14 consecutive games with a right calf injury and likely won't play again until April.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“Nothing angers and saddens me more than not being available to and for my teammates!” James tweeted later Saturday. “I’m hurt inside and out right now. The road back from recovery begins now. Back soon like I never left.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>James was hurt when he rolled his ankle under Solomon Hill, who was called for a foul as he reached awkwardly for a steal. The 36-year-old superstar screamed and fell to the court clutching at his ankle, yet he got up and briefly stayed in the game.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I haven’t necessarily seen him scream and squall like that, probably ever, not even with that groin,” said Kyle Kuzma, who was with the Lakers when James missed 17 games with a groin injury two seasons ago. “It had to hurt a little bit, for sure.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>After the injury, James hit a corner 3-pointer that extended his NBA-record streak of games with at least 10 points to 1,036, but he called a timeout and left the court shortly afterward. James knocked over a chair in frustration as he went to the locker room.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The mood of the team is we’re disappointed we lost, and we’ve got to come back and get one tomorrow,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. “I won’t disclose what LeBron was like (in the locker room). It’s in-house.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>John Collins had 27 points and a season-high 16 rebounds, and Trae Young added 14 points and 11 assists for the Hawks. They opened an eight-game trip with their eighth straight victory under new coach Nate McMillan — but only after their defending champion opponents lost their 17-time All-Star to an injury that could shake the NBA’s balance of power if it turns out to be serious.\u003c/p>\u003cp>With James out, the remaining Lakers rallied and actually took a one-point lead to halftime, but missed their first 11 shots of the second half. Danilo Gallinari scored 14 of his 18 points after halftime for the Hawks, who are on their longest winning streak since January 2015.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“That was the first thing I told the guys: We can’t relax because LeBron is out of the game,\" McMillan said. “We have to keep up the pressure, and I thought our guys did that.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>James’ absence left the Lakers without three starters in the second half, and the Hawks capitalized for their first road victory over Los Angeles since March 2016.

asylum who arrived alone at the U.S.-Mexico border and forcing migrants to wait in Mexico as they made their case to stay in the United States.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>While the administration was working on immigration legislation to address long-term problems, it didn’t have an on-the-ground plan to manage a surge of migrants. Career immigration officials had warned there could be a surge after the presidential election and the news that the Trump policies, widely viewed as cruel, were being reversed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Now officials are scrambling to build up capacity to care for some 14,000 migrants now in federal custody — and more likely on the way — and the administration finds itself on its heels in the \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-mexico-immigration-coronavirus-pandemic-8d5d26f57e1fbf55e2f5222ec6462622\">face of criticism\u003c/a> that it should have been better prepared to deal with a predictable predicament.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='14726f77f0054342b44c2b4b33a5296e' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“They should have forecasted for space (for young migrants) more quickly,” said Ronald Vitiello, a former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and chief of Border Patrol who has served in Republican and Democratic administrations. “And I think in hindsight, maybe they should have waited until they had additional shelter space before they changed the policies.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The situation at the southern border is complex. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Since Biden’s inauguration, the U.S. has seen a dramatic spike in the number of people encountered by border officials. There were 18,945 family members and 9,297 unaccompanied children encountered in February — an increase of 168% and 63%, respectively, from the month before, according to the Pew Research Center. That creates an enormous logistical challenge because children, in particular, require higher standards of care and coordination across agencies.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, the encounters of both unaccompanied minors and families are lower than they were at various points during the Trump administration, including in spring 2019. That May, authorities encountered more than 55,000 migrant children, including 11,500 unaccompanied minors, and about 84,500 migrants traveling in family units.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>\n\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/b923da1cb2254ad59846a033dd670be7\">Career immigration officials\u003c/a>, overwhelmed by the earlier surges, have long warned the flow of migrants to the border could ramp up again. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Biden administration officials have repeatedly laid blame for the current situation on the previous administration, arguing that Biden inherited a mess resulting from President Donald Trump’s undermining and weakening of the immigration system. The White House says it has taken several steps to address the situation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Migrant children are sent from border holding cells to other government facilities until they are released to a sponsor. That process was slowed considerably by a Trump administration policy of “enhanced vetting,” in which details were sent to immigration officials and some sponsors wound up getting arrested, prompting some to fear picking up children over worries of being deported. Biden has reversed that policy, so immigration officials hope the process will speed up now. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The White House also points to Biden’s decision to deploy the Federal Emergency Management Agency, known for helping communities in the aftermath of a natural disaster, to support efforts to process the growing number of unaccompanied migrant children arriving at the border. HHS announced Saturday that it was opening an additional facility in West Texas to help with influx of unaccompanied minors. The facility will initially accommodate about 500 children but can be expanded to house 2,000.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Biden and others have pushed back on the notion that what's happening now is a “crisis.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We will have, I believe, by next month enough of those beds to take care of these children who have no place to go,” Biden said in a recent ABC News interview, when asked whether his administration should have anticipated the surge in young unaccompanied migrants as well as families and adults. He added, “Let’s get something straight though. The vast majority of people crossing the border are being sent back ... immediately sent back.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Adam Isacson, an analyst at the human rights advocacy group Washington Office on Latin America, said Republicans’ insistence that there is a “crisis” at the border is overwrought, but that the surge in migrants was predictable. \u003c/p>\u003cp>He called it a perfect storm of factors: hurricanes that hit Central America last fall; the economic fallout caused by the coronavirus pandemic; typical seasonal migration patterns; the thousands of Central American migrants already stuck at the border for months; and the persistent scourge of gang violence afflicting Northern Triangle countries — Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Isacson said the Biden administration may have been “two or three weeks” slow in preparing for the increase in unaccompanied young migrants and the subsequent housing crunch after announcing in early February it would stop deporting unaccompanied youths. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But Isacson added that the bottleneck was also affected by the lack of cooperation by the Trump administration with the Biden transition. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The Biden administration announced on Feb. 2 it would no longer uphold the Trump administration policy of automatically deporting unaccompanied minors seeking asylum. Two weeks later, the White House announced plans to admit 25,000 asylum-seekers to the U.S. who had been forced to remain in Mexico. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In subsequent weeks, the number of young migrants crossing without adults skyrocketed. Both Customs and Border Protection, and Health and Human Services officials have struggled to house the influx of children. Immigration officials say the number of adult migrants and families trying to enter the U.S. illegally also has surged. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Border patrol officials had encountered more than 29,000 unaccompanied minors since Oct. 1, nearly the same number of youths taken into custody for all of the previous budget year, administration officials say.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Getting capacity up to deal with the unaccompanied minors is critical, but the numbers just don’t bear out to pointing to a crisis,” Isacson said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That hasn’t stopped Republicans -- including Trump and House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California -- from pillorying Biden.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s more than a crisis. This is a human heartbreak,” said McCarthy, who led a delegation of a dozen fellow House Republicans to El Paso, Texas, on Monday.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Biden is also facing criticism from Republicans that his administration has sent mixed messages. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Critics have focused on public comments from Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who earlier this month said the administration's message to migrants was “don’t come now” and a slip by Roberta Jacobson, the White House's lead adviser on the border, who said in Spanish during a recent briefing the “border is not closed,” before correcting herself.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The president and other administration officials in recent days have stepped up efforts to urge migrants not to come. Embassies in Northern Triangle countries are airing public service announcements underscoring the dangers of making the trek north.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Eric Hershberg, director of the Center for Latin American and Latino Studies at American University, said Biden's team faces a powerful counter-narrative as it attempts to persuade desperate Central Americans to stay put: chatter on social media from migrants who successfully made it across the border and smugglers who insist that now is the ideal time.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Hershberg cites a Honduran friend's reaction to U.S. warnings that migrants could face danger on the journey: \"You know, you don’t need to go with such uncertainty. You can just stay here and know that you’ll be raped or killed.”\u003c/p>","truncatedFirstWords":false,"mediaCount":11,"shortId":"1efbf1f357a5210d2433b48820b9aa54","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/1efbf1f357a5210d2433b48820b9aa54","interactiveLinkUrl":null,"organisationTagObjs":{},"downloadSettings":null,"audioMedia":[],"contexts":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"richEmbeds":null,"xxUpdated":"2021-03-21 17:42:12","socialEmbeds":null,"flattenedFirstWords":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Somehow, they didn’t see it coming.\n\nWithin weeks of Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, the Biden administration had reversed many of the most maligned Trump-era immigration...","id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:1efbf1f357a5210d2433b48820b9aa54","media":[],"disableConnatix":false,"hons":false,"headlinePlacement":null,"revision":null,"videoContext":null,"description":null,"embargoDate":null,"reporterKeys":["afs:Reporter:8006374818","afs:Reporter:7516570224"],"omitFromFeed":false,"sponsored":false,"storyLayout":null,"tagIds":["apf-topnews","state-California","Mexico","state-Texas","Immigration","apf-latinamerica","apf-politics","state-Arizona","state-NewMexico","UnitedStates"],"hasTextOverlay":false,"bylines":"By AAMER MADHANI and COLLEEN LONG","leadPhotoId":"7ea5bb2323094db98bb0d63d61e04daf"}],"notificationUrl":null,"textColor":null,"sponsorUrl":null,"teamLimit":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","omitFromFeed":false,"isFullScreen":false,"topLineColor":null,"sponsorServeAd":false,"notificationText":null,"endDateTime":null,"notificationTypeId":null,"notificationUpdated":null},{"feed":[],"pollUpdated":null,"headlineWidget":false,"height":null,"dividerColor":null,"tagObjs":[],"hideDate":false,"virtual":true,"poll_key":null,"sponsorImageUrl":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"borderColor":null,"cardTitle":null,"archived":false,"localMemberName":null,"ignoreAlertMedia":false,"collectionTagObjs":[],"notificationTitle":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"pollFilters":{},"shortId":"73af9c91f568bb8cb74662f91b7d065c","allowAd":true,"layoutType":"Small Photo","pollWeek":null,"sound":null,"disclaimerText":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"xxUpdated":null,"sponsorAttribution":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"hubPositions":null,"textScale":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"customLayoutType":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"cardHeadline":null,"teams":[],"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:73af9c91f568bb8cb74662f91b7d065c","pollId":null,"hideOtherTeams":false,"displayPositionHome":null,"contents":[{"block_fundamentals":true,"embedHeight":null,"stackedStory":false,"contentSponsor":null,"mediumIds":["c895868bba174615b56f2bdc0c0f1b3e","263f8cee87364783bc2466747fbc5b98"],"old_lead_video_key":null,"pullQuoteObjs":[],"title":"US--Biden Aides-Financial Disclosures","headline":"Biden's top aides unlikely to qualify for relief payments","localMemberName":null,"dateline":null,"signals":["newscontent"],"etag":"73af9c91f568bb8cb74662f91b7d065c_0a8aza0c0","latestEtag":null,"updated":"2021-03-20 21:04:17","contentType":"text","canonicalUrl":"donald-trump-joe-biden-politics-barack-obama","embedRatio":null,"audioMediumIds":[],"layoutType":"Small Photo","tagObjs":[{"canonicalName":"joe-biden","order":0,"id":"JoeBiden","isPr":null,"name":"Joe Biden"},{"canonicalName":"donald-trump","order":0,"id":"DonaldTrump","isPr":null,"name":"Donald Trump"},{"canonicalName":"politics","order":6,"id":"apf-politics","isPr":null,"name":"Politics"},{"canonicalName":"barack-obama","order":0,"id":"BarackObama","isPr":null,"name":"Barack Obama"}],"disableNativo":false,"alertLinkDateTime":null,"embedCaption":null,"version":null,"leadVideoAutoEmbed":true,"gcsUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/contents/urn:publicid:ap.org:73af9c91f568bb8cb74662f91b7d065c","embedLinkURL":null,"language":null,"leadVideoId":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — At least one group in America is unlikely to get any money from President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion economic rescue plan — his own top aides.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Most of Biden’s senior West...\u003c/p>","published":"2021-03-20 21:04:16","embedHTML":null,"pubstatus":"usable","slugline":"BC-US--Biden Aides-Financial Disclosures","sequenceNumber":null,"embedType":"Other","notificationId":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":null,"storyHTML":"\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — At least one group in America is unlikely to get any money from President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion economic rescue plan — his own top aides.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Most of Biden’s senior West Wing advisers made far more than the threshold that would qualify them for direct payments from the president’s COVID-19 relief bill, according to White House financial disclosure forms released Saturday.

cancellations. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The top seeds Stanford, South Carolina, N.C. State and UConn are definitely the favorites to win the title on April 4 at the Alamodome. The four No. 2s also are among the favorites to win it all with Louisville, Maryland, Baylor and Texas A&amp;M all title contenders.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“This is as wide-open a year as any. Last year maybe it was Oregon or people might say South Carolina,” Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer said. “Past years there’s been Baylor with Brittney Griner or Connecticut with Maya Moore but I think this year is wide open. There are a lot of different teams that could win this tournament. I think it will be very exciting and great for TV.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>History is on the side of the top teams.

If you come in thinking that this team is No. 1 or No. 2, you have no chance,\" said Blair, whose Aggies are a two-seed. \"But if you come in with a no-fear attitude, Cinderellas happen all the time.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’ve been a lower-seeded team at Arkansas. I’m still the lowest-seeded team that ever made the Final Four when I was at Arkansas as a No 9 seed. We had the opportunity out at Stanford to see a No 16 beat a No 1 ... That’s always been a great teaching lesson to me.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Even if that trend doesn't change, there are more teams capable of pulling off upsets and at least reaching the Final Four especially since there were fewer regular season games and practices than there would be during normal year. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The talent also seems to be more spread out now.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A look at the \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/womens-basketball-womens-college-basketball-basketball-maya-moore-kentucky-f33cc241b63e89787478c2b3a104fed0\">AP All-America team\u003c/a> and for the first time ever there were 15 different schools represented on it. Throughout the season, the No. 1 team in the poll changed four times— the second most all-time. N.C. State and Stanford both lost games to unranked teams this season.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Also, with all the NCAA Tournament being played on neutral courts there’s a better chance that there will be more upsets as lower-seeded teams won’t have to win on a higher-seeded squad’s homecourt to advance to the Sweet 16.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Any team that will make a deep run will have to deal with the mental aspect as well. A school that wins the national championship will have spent nearly three weeks in San Antonio cooped up in their hotel.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Stanford, the overall No. 1 seed, might be in the best position to overcome that. The Cardinal spent nine weeks away from home because of the virus. If they can, VanDerveer could win her first national championship since 1992.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I think it helps,” the Hall of Fame coach said. “We’re used to testing every day and used to eating in our rooms. It has prepared us for this. We’ve been her done this, we can handle it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>VanDerveer tells her players their middle name has to be “flexible.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some other things to watch for in the tournament:\u003c/p>\u003cp>FRESH FACES: \u003c/p>\u003cp>There are a lot of \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/ca043f789763919638aa88da2375094b\">talented freshmen\u003c/a> and sophomores who are making their debuts in the NCAAs.

Airing myriad complaints, the Biden administration took an extraordinarily tough line with China and Russia last week. Public spats between the countries erupted as Biden criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin for being “a killer” and his top national security aides excoriated China for a litany of issues. Moscow and Beijing both fired back, setting the stage for months, if not more. of escalating tensions that are unlikely to be resolved without intense discussions at the leadership level and major concessions from all sides. Biden himself kicked off the latest round of recrimination in an interview on Wednesday in which he sought to draw clear differences between his Russia policies and those of former President Donald Trump. who was accused of being soft on Putin. Just 24 hours later, Biden's top diplomat and national security adviser blasted Chinese officials in face-to-face talks. Although Biden's strong comments about Putin reflected a shift from Trump's often conciliatory approach to the Kremlin, the harsh criticism directed at China by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan in many ways mirrored the previous administration's hardline stance toward Beijing. The contrasting styles suggested that Biden is intent on reversing years of perceived U.S. weakness toward Russia while rejecting Trump's 2020 campaign allegations that he's not tough enough on China. In taking a strong line on Russia, Biden has said the days of the U.S. “rolling over” to Putin are done. And, in an interview with ABC broadcast on Wednesday, Biden replied “I do” when asked if he thought Putin was a “killer.” Russia responded by recalling its ambassador in Washington for consultations. Putin then shot back by pointing to the U.S. history of slavery, the slaughter of Native Americans and the atomic bombing of Japan in World War II in an “it-takes-one-to-know-one” response. As that was unfolding, on Thursday in Alaska, China's top two diplomats reacted in similar fashion to criticism from Blinken and Sullivan about Beijing's human rights record in the western Xinjiang region and Tibet and its aggressive actions in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the South China Sea. Communist Party foreign policy chief Yang Jiechi and Foreign Minister Wang Yi accused the U.S. of hypocrisy for condemning China while at the same time grappling with its own internal issues, including violence against Asian-Americans, other people of color and political unrest following the 2020 presidential election. Blinken and Sullivan took umbrage at those comments and replied that the U.S. was not perfect but sought to openly and honestly address such matters. Sullivan said that Americans' willingness to confront their shortcomings were the “secret sauce” of U.S. success. And, they sought to reframe U.S.-China relations in the context of the Biden administration's resolve to correct those issues, strengthen the U.S. economy and improve ties with democratic allies in Asia such as Australia, Japan and South Korea. Blinken, having just finished a trip to Japan and South Korea with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, made clear to the Chinese that the U.S. is aligned with its allies. “I have to tell you, what I’m hearing is very different from what you described,” he told Wang and Yang. “I’m hearing deep satisfaction that the United States is back, that we’re re-engaged with our allies and partners. I’m also hearing deep concern about some of the actions your government has taken.” A similar effort with allies is underway in Europe with respect to Russia. Blinken will leave Monday for Brussels for talks with NATO and European Union officials designed to repair strains caused by Trump's largely transactional diplomacy. Trump's bluster, threats of trade wars and intense demands that Europe pay more for its defense angered many, particularly in the continent's two major powers: France and Germany. That trip is aimed at underscoring “the Biden Administration’s determination to strengthen the transatlantic alliance and reinvigorate our ties with allies through NATO” with an eye toward challenges posed by both Russia and China, the State Department said. Russia’s relations with the United States and the European Union already had plunged to post-Cold War lows after Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, meddling in elections, hacking attacks and, most recently, the jailing of Russia’s opposition leader Alexei Navalny after his poisoning, which he blamed on the Kremlin. Russian authorities rejected the accusations. Then, the U.S. national intelligence director’s office released a report finding that Putin authorized influence operations to help Trump’s reelection bid. The Biden administration warned that Russia would face sanctions soon over its attempt to influence the election and the massive SolarWinds hacks. “(Putin) will pay a price,” Biden said in the ABC interview when asked about the declassified report.\">Moscow\u003c/a> and \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/alaska-china-1b1cb3c09cfc2775731b8a408f602600\">Beijing\u003c/a> both fired back, setting the stage for months, if not more, of escalating tensions that are unlikely to be resolved without intense discussions at the leadership level and major concessions from all sides. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='fb9e78c1d9804b3e946c8cd1b409ee41' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Biden himself kicked off the latest round of recrimination in a television interview in which he sought to draw clear differences between his Russia policies and those of former President Donald Trump. who was accused of being soft on Putin.

Restrictions on nonessential travel were put in place a year ago to curb the spread of the virus and have been extended almost every month since, with exceptions for trade, trucking and critical supply chains. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Small businesses, residents and local chambers of commerce say the financial toll has been steep, as have the disruptions to life in communities where it’s common to shop, work and sleep in two different countries.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Border communities are those that rely — economically, socially, and yes, health wise — on the daily and essential travel of tourist visa holders,\" the presidents of 10 chambers of commerce in Arizona, Texas and California border cities wrote in a \u003ca href=\"https://files.constantcontact.com/810149b7201/4e3d4b0f-dd16-470e-a2d7-5758689a41b8.pdf\">letter\u003c/a> last month to the Homeland Security and Transportation departments.

In border cities like Brownsville, Laredo and El Paso, January's non-seasonally adjusted unemployment rates of 9.5%, 8.9% and 7.4%, respectively, were close enough to the state's rate of 7.3% to suggest the restrictions have had less impact on larger, more diversified border economies than elsewhere.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“What I have seen over the years is that the border adjusts to these shocks in a very peculiar way,” Cañas said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In Nogales, the economic wear from nearly 12 months of a partially shut border is easy to spot in the historic downtown. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Bargain clothing stores, money exchanges, secondhand shops and retailers selling plastic knickknacks within walking distance of the border were closed. Many storefronts were boarded up.\u003c/p>\u003cp>​Olivia Ainza-Kramer, president of the Nogales Chamber of Commerce, said the loss in revenue from the drop in Mexican shoppers over the past year has been felt most acutely by businesses closest to the border that tend to be family-owned and cater to pedestrian shoppers. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Further north, big-box retailers and other stores have fared a little better because they're visited by residents of the town of 20,000, she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Kory, who owns the bridal shop, saw the contrast up close. His family has three clothing stores in Nogales. Two are steps from the U.S.-Mexico port of entry — and both closed — while a third is about 4 miles (6 kilometers) from the border.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Kory said his family has managed to keep the third store open, albeit sales are down 75% to 80% from pre-pandemic levels. Most of the customers are Nogales locals, he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We’ve seen the evolution at the international border, you know, from the '40s ... in my family,\" he said. “This is the first time that we’ve had a closure.\" \u003c/p>\u003cp>Kory said the business has kept just four of its usual 27 employees.

The documents show that 10 people had been arrested on prostitution charges, but none since 2013.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The suspect in the shootings, a 21-year-old white man, considered the women inside the spas “sources of temptation,” police said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Grace Pai, a director of organizing at Chicago’s Asian Americans Advancing Justice branch, called that characterization of the attacks “a real slap in the face to anyone who identifies as an Asian American woman.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We know exactly what this racialized misogyny looks like,” Pai said. “And to think that someone targeted three Asian-owned businesses that were staffed by Asian American women … and didn’t have race or gender in mind is just absurd.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Framing the women who were killed as “sources of temptation” places blame on the women as the ones “who were there to tempt the shooter, who is merely the victim of temptation,” said Catherine Ceniza Choy, a University of California, Berkeley, professor of ethnic studies and a Filipino American woman. She said this scenario echoes a long-running stereotype that Asian women are immoral and hypersexual.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“That may be the way the alleged shooter and killer thinks of it, that you can compartmentalize race in this box and sex addiction in a separate box. But it doesn’t work that way,” Choy said. “These things are intertwined, and race is central to this conversation.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Stereotypes of Asian women as “dragon ladies” or sexually available partners have been around for centuries. From the moment Asian women began to migrate to the U.S., they were the targets of hypersexualization, said Ellen Wu, a history professor at Indiana University. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The Page Act of 1875 prohibited women coming to the U.S. from anywhere for “immoral purposes,” but the law was largely enforced against Chinese women.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“As early as the 1870s, white Americans were already making this association, this assumption of Asian women being walking sex objects,” Wu said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Asian lives are seen as “interchangeable and disposable,” she said. “They are objectified, seen as less than human. That helps us understand violence toward Asian women like we saw this week.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>U.S. military deployments in Asia also played a role, according to Kim. She said the military has long fueled sex trafficking there, starting after the Spanish-American War, when traffickers and brothel owners in the Philippines bought and sold women and girls to meet the demands of U.S. soldiers. \u003c/p>\u003cp>During the Vietnam War, women from Thailand and many other Asian countries were used for sex by U.S. soldiers at various “rest and recreation” spots. The bodies and perceived submissiveness of Asian women were eroticized and hypersexualized, Kim said, and eventually these racist stereotypes were brought back to the United States.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In American culture, Asian woman have been fetishized as submissive, hypersexual and exotic, said Christine Bacareza Balance, an Asian American studies professor at Cornell University and a Filipina woman.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A prime example is the wildly popular 1887 novel, “Madame Chrysanthème,” a French narrative, translated into English, in which Japanese women are referred to as “playthings” and “China ornaments.” More recently, an Asian woman has generally been portrayed in films as either “a manipulative, dragon lady temptress or the submissive, innocent ‘lotus blossom’ meant to please a man,” Balance said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Choy, the ethnic studies professor at Berkeley, said Tuesday’s shootings and subsequent efforts to remove race from the conversation is yet another example of the denial of the racism and sexism Asian and Asian American women face.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In American society, Asian Americans are not seen and listened to,” she said. “We are seen in specific ways at times, as model minorities, as projections of white, male fantasy, but we are not seen as full-fledged Americans.
